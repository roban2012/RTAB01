	<hr><br>
	
(Information as of December 31, 2013 and for the nine months ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 is unaudited) 

 <br><br>

1. Organization and principal activities  
<br><br>
Alibaba Group Holding Limited (the “Company”, and where appropriate, the term “Company” also refers to its subsidiaries and variable interest entities as a whole), was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on June 28, 1999. The Company is a holding company and conducts its businesses primarily through its subsidiaries and variable interest entities (“VIEs”). The Company is principally engaged in online and mobile commerce through products, services and technology that enable businesses to operate efficiently and extend their reach to sell to consumers and businesses in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or “China”) and internationally. Major shareholders of the Company include SoftBank Corp. (“SoftBank”) and Yahoo! Inc. (“Yahoo”). 
<br><br>
The Company provides retail and wholesale marketplaces available through both personal computer and mobile interfaces in the PRC and internationally. Retail marketplaces and services operated by the Company include (i) the China online shopping destination (“Taobao Marketplace”); (ii) the China brands and retail platform (“Tmall”); (iii) the China group buying site that offers quality products by aggregating demand from consumers mainly through limited time discounted sales (“Juhuasuan”); and (iv) the global consumer marketplace targeting consumers around the world (“AliExpress”). Wholesale marketplaces operated by the Company include the online China wholesale marketplace (“1688.com”) and the online business-to-business marketplace that focuses on global trade among businesses from around the world (“Alibaba.com”). In addition, the Company offers cloud computing services, including elastic computing, database services and storage and large scale computing services, for the Company’s own platforms and the platforms of the Company’s related companies and for use by sellers on the marketplaces and other third-party customers (“Alibaba Cloud Computing”). In addition, the Company makes available online payment processing services (“Payment Services”) on its marketplaces through an arrangement with Alipay.com Co., Ltd. (“Alipay”), the entity operating the Payment Services (Note 4(c)(iii)). The Company derives substantially all of its revenue from the PRC. 
<br><br>
Alibaba.com Limited, a subsidiary of the Company which operates Alibaba.com, 1688.com and AliExpress, was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Limited on November 6, 2007. As of March 31, 2012, 27.2% of the economic interests held by public shareholders were accounted for as noncontrolling interests in the Company’s financial statements. On June 20, 2012, the privatization of Alibaba.com Limited by way of a scheme of arrangement under Section 86 of the Cayman Islands Companies Law was approved and accordingly the listing of the shares of Alibaba.com Limited on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was withdrawn (Note 4(b)). Following the privatization, Alibaba.com Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

	<b><a name="T2">2. Summary of significant accounting policies</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

(a) Basis of presentation  
<br><br>
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). 

 <br><br>

(b) Unaudited interim consolidated financial information  
<br><br>
The accompanying interim consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013, and the consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and statements of cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 and the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity for the nine months ended December 31, 2013 and the related footnote disclosures are unaudited. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all adjustments as necessary for the fair statement of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of December 31, 2013 and for the nine months ended December 31, 2012 and 2013. 

 <br><br>

(c) Use of estimates  
<br><br>
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T3">(d) Consolidation</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries, including the wholly-foreign owned enterprises (“WFOEs”), and VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All transactions and balances among the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs have been eliminated upon consolidation. The results of subsidiaries and VIEs acquired or disposed of during the year are recorded in the consolidated income statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
<br><br>
A subsidiary is an entity in which (i) the Company directly or indirectly controls more than 50% of the voting power; or (ii) the Company has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors or to cast a majority of votes at the meeting of the board of directors or to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee pursuant to a statute or under an agreement among the shareholders or equity holders. A VIE entity is required to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the nominee equity holders in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. 
<br><br>
To comply with the PRC laws, rules and regulations that restrict foreign ownership of companies that operate Internet content and other restricted businesses, the Company operates its websites and engages in such restricted services in the PRC through certain PRC domestic companies, whose equity interests are held by certain management members of the Company. The registered capital of these PRC domestic companies was funded by the Company through loans extended to management members. The Company has entered into certain exclusive technical services agreements with these PRC domestic companies, which entitle it to receive a majority of their residual returns and make it obligatory for the Company to absorb a majority of the risk of losses from their activities. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements with those management members, including loan agreements that require them to contribute registered capital to those PRC domestic companies, exclusive call option agreements to acquire the equity interests in these companies when permitted by the PRC laws, rules and regulations, equity pledge agreements of the equity interests held by those management members, and proxy agreements that irrevocably authorize individuals designated by the Company to exercise the equity owner’s rights over these PRC domestic companies. 
<br><br>
Details of the typical VIE structure of the Company’s significant VIEs, primarily domestic companies associated with the operations of Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, Juhuasuan, 1688.com, Alibaba.com and AliExpress, are set forth below: 

 <br><br>

  i) Contracts that give the Company power to direct the activities of VIEs that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance  
<br><br>
Loan agreements 
<br><br>
Pursuant to the relevant loan agreements, the respective WFOEs have granted interest-free loans to the relevant nominee equity holders of the VIEs, which may only be used for the purpose of capital contributions to the relevant VIEs or as may be otherwise agreed by the WFOEs. The WFOEs may require acceleration of repayment at their absolute discretion. When the nominee equity holders of the VIEs make early repayment of the outstanding amount, the WFOEs or a third party designated by the WFOEs may purchase the equity interests in the VIEs at a price equal to the outstanding amount of the loan, subject to any applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. The nominee equity holders of VIEs undertake not to enter into any prohibited transactions in relation to the VIEs, including the transfer of any business, material assets, intellectual property rights or equity interests in the VIEs to any third party. 
<br><br>
Exclusive call option agreements 
<br><br>
The nominee equity holders of the VIEs have granted the WFOEs exclusive call options to purchase their equity interest in the VIEs at an exercise price equal to the higher of (i) the registered capital in the VIEs; and (ii) the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws. Each relevant VIE has further granted the relevant WFOE an exclusive call option to purchase its assets at an exercise price equal to the book value of the assets or the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws, whichever is higher. The WFOEs may nominate another entity or individual to purchase the equity interest or assets, if applicable, under the call options. Each call option is exercisable subject to the condition that applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations do not prohibit completion of the transfer of the equity interest or assets pursuant to the call option. Each WFOE is entitled to all dividends and other distributions declared by the VIE, and the nominee equity holders of VIE have agreed to give up their rights to receive any distributions or proceeds from the disposal of their equity interests in the VIE which are in excess of the original registered capital that they contributed to the VIE, and to pay any such distributions or premium to the WFOE. The exclusive call option agreements remain in effect until the equity interest or assets that are the subject of such agreements are transferred to the WFOEs. 
<br><br>
Proxy agreements 
<br><br>
Pursuant to the relevant proxy agreements, each of the nominee equity holders of the VIEs irrevocably authorizes any person designated by the WFOEs to exercise his rights as an equity holder of the VIEs, including the right to attend and vote at equity holder meetings and appoint directors. 
<br><br>
Equity pledge agreements 
<br><br>
Pursuant to the relevant equity pledge agreements, the relevant nominee equity holders of the VIEs have pledged all of their interests in the equity of the VIEs as a continuing first priority security interest in favor of the WFOEs to secure the outstanding amounts advanced under the relevant loan agreements described above and to secure the performance of obligations by the VIEs and/or the nominee equity holders of the VIEs under the other structure contracts. Each WFOE is entitled to exercise its right to dispose of the pledged interests in the equity of the VIE and has priority in receiving payment by the application of proceeds from the auction or sale of such pledged interests, in the event of any breach or default under the loan agreement or other structure contracts, if applicable. These equity pledge agreements remain in force for the duration of the relevant loan agreement and other structure contracts. These equity pledges have been registered with the relevant office of the Administrations for Industry and Commerce in the PRC. 

 <br><br>

  ii) Contracts that enable the Company to receive benefits from the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs or to absorb losses of the VIEs that could be significant to the VIEs  
<br><br>
Exclusive technical services agreements 
<br><br>
Each relevant VIE has entered into an exclusive technical services agreement with the respective WFOE, pursuant to which the relevant WFOE provides exclusive technical services to the VIE. In exchange, the VIE pays a service fee to the WFOE which typically constitutes substantially all of the VIE’s pre-tax profit, resulting in a transfer of substantially all of the profits from the VIE to the WFOE. 
<br><br>
Other arrangements 
<br><br>
The exclusive call option agreements described above also enable the Company to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from the VIEs by typically entitling the WFOEs to all dividends and other distributions declared by the VIEs and to any distributions or proceeds from the disposal by the nominee equity holders of the VIEs of their equity interests in the VIEs that are in excess of the original registered capital that they contributed to the VIEs. 
<br><br>
Based on these contractual agreements, the Company believes that the PRC domestic companies as described above should be considered as VIEs because the nominee equity holders do not have significant equity at risk nor do they have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest and the Company is the primary beneficiary of these PRC domestic companies. Accordingly, the Company believes that these VIEs should be consolidated based on the structure as described above. 
<br><br>
The following financial information of the VIEs in the PRC was recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements: <br><br>
<a href= "pic101.html">VIEs</a><br><br>
Under the contractual arrangements with the VIEs, the Company has the power to direct activities of the VIEs and can have assets transferred out of the VIEs under its control. Therefore, the Company considers that there is no asset in any of the consolidated VIEs that can be used only to settle obligations of the VIEs, except for registered capital and PRC statutory reserves. As all consolidated VIEs are incorporated as limited liability companies under the PRC Company Law, creditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company for any of the liabilities of the consolidated VIEs.<br><br> 

Currently there is no contractual arrangement which requires the Company to provide additional financial support to the VIEs. However, as the Company conducts its businesses primarily based on the licenses and approvals held by its VIEs, the Company has provided and will continue to provide financial support to the VIEs considering the business requirements of the VIEs, as well as the Company’s own business objectives in the future. 
<br><br>
Unrecognized revenue-producing assets held by the VIEs include certain Internet content provision and others licenses, domain names and trademarks. 
<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T4">(e) Business combinations and noncontrolling interests</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities incurred by the Company to the sellers and equity instruments issued. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling interests. The excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition, fair value of the noncontrolling interests and acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over (ii) the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated income statement. 
<br><br>
In a business combination achieved in stages, the Company re-measures the previously held equity interest in the acquiree immediately before obtaining control at its acquisition-date fair value and the re-measurement gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated income statement. 
<br><br>
For the Company’s majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs, a noncontrolling interest is recognized to reflect the portion of their equity which is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. Consolidated net income (loss) on the consolidated income statements includes the net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The cumulative results of operations attributable to noncontrolling interests, along with adjustments for share-based compensation expense arising from outstanding share-based awards relating to subsidiaries’ shares, are recorded as noncontrolling interests in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Cash flows related to transactions with noncontrolling interests are presented under financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
<br><br>
(f) Segment reporting  
<br><br>
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker, which is a strategic committee comprised of members of the Company’s management team. In the respective periods presented, the Company had one single operating and reportable segment, namely the provision of online and mobile commerce and related services. Although the online and mobile commerce and related services consist of different operating units of the Company, the chief operating decision-maker considers that these underlying operations are subject to similar risks and returns. Therefore, information regarding the business segments provided to the chief operating decision-maker is at the revenue level and the Company does not allocate operating costs or assets to its business units, as the chief operating decision-maker does not use such information to allocate resources or evaluate the performance of the operating segments. Details of the Company’s revenue are set out in Note 5. As the Company’s long-lived assets are substantially all located in the PRC and substantially all of the Company’s revenue is derived from within the PRC, no geographical information is presented. 

 <br><br>

(g) Foreign currency translation  
<br><br>
The functional currency of the Company is the United States Dollar (“US$”) and reporting currency of the Company is Renminbi (“RMB”). The Company’s subsidiaries and VIEs with operations in the PRC, Hong Kong, United States and other jurisdictions use their respective currencies as their functional currencies. The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries and VIEs, other than the subsidiaries and VIEs with the functional currency of RMB, are translated into RMB using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and average exchange rate for the year for income and expense items. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a component of shareholders’ equity. 
<br><br>
In the financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries and VIEs, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are measured and recorded in the functional currency using the exchange rate in effect at the date of the transaction. At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. All gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions are recorded in the determination of net income or loss during the year in which they occur.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T5">(h) Revenue recognition</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Revenue principally represents online marketing services revenue, commissions on transactions, membership and storefront fees and cloud computing services revenue. Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of services in the ordinary course of the Company’s activities and is recorded net of value added tax (“VAT”). Consistent with the criteria of ASC 605 “Revenue Recognition” (“ASC 605”), the Company recognizes revenue when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been provided, (iii) the selling price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. 
<br><br>
Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting and arrangement consideration is allocated using the best estimate of selling prices if the Company does not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the selling prices of the deliverables. 
<br><br>
In accordance with ASC 605, the Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. When the Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. When the Company is not the primary obligor, does not bear the inventory risk and does not have the ability to establish the price, revenue is recorded on a net basis. 
<br><br>
When services are exchanged or swapped for other services, the exchange is regarded as a revenue-generating transaction unless such exchange was made for services of a similar nature and value, which is not regarded as a revenue-generating transaction. The revenue is measured at the fair value of the services received, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents transferred. When the fair value of the services received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the services provided in a barter transaction, by reference to non-barter transactions involving similar services, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents transferred. The amount of revenue recognized for barter transactions was insignificant for each of the periods presented. 
<br><br>
Revenue recognition policies for each type of service are analyzed as follows: 
<br><br>
Online marketing services revenue 
<br><br>
The Company receives service fees from merchants on the retail and wholesale marketplaces for pay for performance (“P4P”) marketing services, display marketing and placement services on the Company’s marketplaces and certain third party marketing affiliates’ websites. P4P marketing services allow merchants to bid for keywords that match product or service listings appearing in search or browser results. P4P marketing service fees are charged to merchants in advance and the related revenue is recognized when a consumer clicks such product or service listings, where the positioning of such information and the price for such positioning are determined through an online auction system, which facilitates price discovery through a market-based mechanism. 
<br><br>
Display marketing allows merchants and other advertisers to place advertisements on particular areas of a web page, at fixed prices or prices established by a real-time bidding system, in particular formats and over particular periods of time. Display marketing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the period in which the advertisement is displayed or when an advertisement appears on pages clicked or viewed by users, and only if collection of the resulting receivable is probable. 
<br><br>
The Company receives placement services fees from merchants on promotional slots for a specified period on the Company’s Juhuasuan marketplace and recognizes those fees as revenue when the underlying promotional services are provided. 
<br><br>
In addition, the Company generates commissions from merchants for transactions paid for through Alipay and completed by buyers sourced from certain third party marketing affiliates’ websites. Such commission revenue is recognized at the time when the underlying transaction is completed. 
<br><br>
Commissions on transactions 
<br><br>
The Company earns commissions from merchants when transactions are completed on certain retail marketplaces of the Company. Such commissions are generally determined as a percentage based on the value of merchandise being sold by the merchants and paid for through Alipay. Revenue related to commissions is recognized in the consolidated income statements at the time when the underlying transaction is completed. 
<br><br>
Membership and storefront fees 
<br><br>
The Company earns membership revenue from merchants in respect of the sale of membership packages and subscriptions that provide placement of the merchants’ premium storefronts on our wholesale marketplaces. The Company also earns storefront fees from merchants in respect of tools that assist sellers in upgrading, decorating and managing their storefronts on retail marketplaces. These service fees are paid in advance for a specific contracted service period. All these fees are initially deferred when received and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the respective service contracts as the services are provided. 
<br><br>
Cloud computing and Internet infrastructure revenue 
<br><br>
The Company earns revenue from cloud computing and Internet infrastructure from the provision of services such as elastic computing, database services and storage and large scale computing services, as well as web hosting and domain name registration. Revenue is recognized at the time when the services are provided or ratably over the term of the service contracts as appropriate. 
<br><br>
Interest and other income 
<br><br>
Interest income on micro loans (Note 2(s)) is recognized as revenue using the effective interest rate method which is reviewed and adjusted periodically based on changes in estimated cash flows. Other interest income is recognized on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method, and is classified as “interest and investment income” in the consolidated income statements. Other than the above, receipts of fees in respect of all other incidental services provided by the Company are recognized when services are delivered. 
<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T6">(i) Cost of revenue</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Cost of revenue consists primarily of payment processing fees, traffic acquisition costs, expenses associated with the operation of the Company’s websites, such as bandwidth and co-location fees, depreciation and maintenance costs for computers, servers, call centers and other equipment, staff costs and share-based compensation expense, unit-volume driven rebates, business tax and related surcharges, allowance for doubtful accounts in relation to the micro loans and other related incidental expenses that are directly attributable to the Company’s principal operations. Following recent reforms of PRC tax laws, business tax is gradually being replaced by VAT, which is recorded as a reduction of revenue, starting from the year ended March 31, 2013. 

 <br><br>

(j) Product development expenses  
<br><br>
Product development expenses consist primarily of staff costs and share-based compensation expense and other related incidental expenses that are directly attributable to the development, maintenance and enhancement of the infrastructure, applications, operating systems, software, database and network for the Company’s marketplaces, mobile products as well as transaction and service platforms. In addition, royalty fees accrued and paid to Yahoo are recorded as part of product development expenses (Note 21). 
<br><br>
The Company expenses all costs that are incurred in connection with the planning and implementation phases of development and costs that are associated with repair or maintenance of the existing websites or the development of software and website content. Costs incurred in the development phase are capitalized and amortized over the estimated product life. However, since the inception of the Company, the amount of costs qualifying for capitalization has been insignificant and as a result, all website and software development costs have been expensed as incurred. 

 <br><br>

(k) Sales and marketing expenses  
<br><br>
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of online and offline marketing expenses, promotion expenses, sales commissions, staff costs and share-based compensation expense and other related incidental expenses that are incurred directly to attract or retain buyers and sellers for the Company’s marketplaces. 
<br><br>
The Company expenses the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs, and expenses the costs of communicating advertisements in the period in which the advertising space or airtime is used. Advertising and promotional expenses totaled RMB938 million, RMB1,312 million and RMB1,363 million during the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, respectively. 

 <br><br>

(l) Share-based compensation  
<br><br>
Share-based awards granted to the Company’s employees are measured at fair value on grant date and share-based compensation expense is recognized (i) immediately at the grant date if no vesting conditions are required, or (ii) using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. The fair value of share options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the fair value of restricted shares and restricted share units (“RSUs”) is determined with reference to the fair value of the underlying shares. Share-based awards granted to non-employees are initially measured at fair value on the grant date and remeasured at each reporting date through the vesting date. Such value is recognized as expense over the respective service period, net of estimated forfeitures. Share-based compensation expense, when recognized, is charged to the consolidated income statements with the corresponding entry to additional paid-in capital or noncontrolling interests as disclosed in Note 2(e). 

 <br><br>

At each date of measurement, the Company reviews internal and external sources of information to assist in the estimation of various attributes to determine the fair value of the share-based awards granted by the Company, including but not limited to the fair value of the underlying shares, expected life, expected volatility and expected forfeiture rates. As the Company is a private company, the sources utilized to determine those attributes at the date of measurement are subjective in nature and require the Company to use judgment in applying such information to the share valuation models. The Company is required to consider many factors and make certain assumptions during this assessment. If any of the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the share-based awards changes significantly, share-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current reporting period. 

 <br><br>

(m) Other employee benefits  
<br><br>
The Company’s subsidiaries and VIEs in the PRC participate in a government-mandated multi-employer defined contribution plan pursuant to which certain retirement, medical and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. The relevant labor regulations require the Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC to pay the local labor and social welfare authorities monthly contributions at a stated contribution rate based on the monthly basic compensation of qualified employees. The relevant local labor and social welfare authorities are responsible for meeting all retirement benefits obligations and the Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC have no further commitments beyond their monthly contributions. The contributions to the plan are expensed as incurred. During the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, contributions to such plan amounting to RMB693 million, RMB816 million and RMB721 million, respectively, were charged to the consolidated income statements. 
<br><br>
The Company also makes payments to other defined contribution plans for the benefit of employees employed by subsidiaries outside the PRC. Amounts contributed during the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013 were insignificant. 

 
<br><br>
(n) Income taxes  
<br><br>
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realizable in the foreseeable future. 
<br><br>
Deferred taxes are also recognized on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, which are presumed to be transferred to the parent company and are subject to withholding taxes, unless there is sufficient evidence to show that the subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely or that the earnings will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation. 
<br><br>
The Company adopts ASC 740-10-25 “Income Taxes” which prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures. The Company did not have significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions or any unrecognized liabilities, interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit as of and for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013. 
<br><br>
 

(o) Government grants  
<br><br>
For government grants that are non-operating in nature and with no further conditions to be met, the amounts are recognized as income in other income, net when received. For government grants that contain certain operating conditions, the amounts are recorded as liabilities when received, and are recognized in the consolidated income statements as a reduction of the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate when the conditions are met. 
<br><br>
 

(p) Operating leases  
<br><br>
Leases where substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership of assets remain with the lessor are accounted for as operating leases. Rentals applicable to such operating leases are charged to the consolidated income statements on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

	<b><a name="T7">(q) Cash and cash equivalents</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents of the Company primarily represent bank deposits, fixed deposits with maturities less than three months and investments in money market funds. As of March 31, 2012, March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013, the Company had certain amounts of cash held in accounts managed by Alipay in connection with the provision of online and mobile commerce and related services for a total amount of RMB760 million, RMB898 million and RMB1,501 million, respectively, which have been classified as cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheets. 

 <br><br>

(r) Short-term investments  
<br><br>
Short-term investments consist primarily of investments in fixed deposits with maturities between three months and one year. 
<br><br>
 

(s) Loan receivables and secured borrowings  
<br><br>
Loan receivables consist primarily of micro loans provided to small enterprises that are merchants on the Company’s marketplaces. Such amounts are recorded at the principal amount less allowance for doubtful accounts relating to micro loans, and include accrued interest receivable as of the balance sheet date. Allowance for doubtful accounts relating to micro loans represents the Company’s best estimate of the losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of loans. The loan periods extended by the Company to the merchants generally range from 7 days to 360 days. Judgement is required to determine the allowance amounts and whether such amounts are adequate to cover potential bad debts, and periodic reviews are performed to ensure such amounts continue to reflect the best estimate of the losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of debts. As of March 31, 2012, March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013, allowance for doubtful accounts relating to micro loans amounted to RMB12 million, RMB190 million and RMB544 million, respectively. For the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, the charge-offs and recoveries in relation to the allowance for doubtful accounts relating to micro loans were insignificant. 
<br><br>
The Company has entered into arrangements with certain third party financial institutions under which the Company has transferred the legal titles or economic benefits in certain loan receivables in exchange for cash proceeds. The Company continues to provide management, administration and collection services on the transferred loan receivables and is subject to certain provisions which require the Company to absorb a portion of the losses incurred in the outstanding portfolio of loan receivables in the event of default. The Company is considered to have retained control over the transferred loan receivables due to the existence of such provisions, and accordingly such loan receivables did not meet the requirements for asset derecognition. Accordingly, the Company recognizes such loan receivables as pledged assets, and the proceeds received from the transfers are recognized as secured borrowings. Such pledged assets recorded in loan receivables amounted to nil, RMB2,429 million and RMB9,766 million as of March 31, 2012, March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013, respectively. 
<br><br>
 

(t) Investment securities  
<br><br>
The classification of investment securities is based on the Company’s intent, which is re-evaluated at each balance sheet date, with respect to those securities. Investment securities classified as trading securities, comprising of listed equity securities and financial derivatives such as warrants and equity swaps used as market access products to invest in listed equity securities in the PRC, are carried at fair value with realized or unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated income statements. The securities that the Company has positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities and stated at amortized cost. Other investment securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and provision for decline in value judged to be other than temporary, if any, are recognized in the consolidated income statements. In computing realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, the Company determines cost based on amounts paid, including direct costs such as commissions to acquire the security, using the average cost method. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method which is reviewed and adjusted periodically based on changes in estimated cash flows. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive the payment is established.

	<b><a name="T8">(u) Land use rights</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Land use rights represent lease prepayments to the local Bureau of Land and Resources. Land use rights are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Amortization is provided to write off the cost of lease prepayments on a straight-line basis over the period of the right which is 40 - 70 years. 
<br><br>
(v) Property and equipment  
<br><br>
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization less any provision required for impairment in value. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method with no residual value based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets, which range as follows: 

 <br><br>

   
Computer equipment and software
    3 - 5 years <br><br>
Furniture, office and transportation equipment
    3 - 5 years <br><br>
Buildings
    20 - 50 years <br><br>
Leasehold improvements
    shorter of remaining lease period or estimated useful life <br><br>

Construction in progress represents buildings and related premises under construction, which is stated at actual construction cost less any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to the respective category of property and equipment when completed and ready for its intended use. 
<br><br>
Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred and asset improvements are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization of assets disposed of or retired are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated income statements.

	<b><a name="T9">(w) Goodwill</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired entity as a result of the Company’s acquisitions of interests in its subsidiaries and VIEs. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers primary factors such as industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations. Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is performed. 
<br><br>
In performing the two-step quantitative impairment test, the first step compares the fair values of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This allocation process is only performed for the purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment and does not result in an entry to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities. Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T10">(x) Intangible assets</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions are recognized as assets separate from goodwill if they satisfy either the “contractual-legal” or “separability” criterion. Purchased intangible assets and intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of subsidiaries and VIE subsidiaries are recognized and measured at fair value upon acquisition. Separately identifiable intangible assets that have determinable lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method as follows: 
<br><br>
 

   
User base and customer relationships
    2 - 6 years <br><br>
Trade names, trademarks and domain names
    5 - 12 years <br><br>
Existing technology
    2 - 5 years <br><br>
Non-compete agreements
    over the contracted term from 4 - 6 years <br><br>

Separately identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss for identifiable intangible assets is based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset. 

 <br><br>

(y) Impairment of long-lived assets  <br><br>

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. No impairment of long-lived assets other than investment in equity investees, intangible assets and goodwill was recognized for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013. 

 <br><br>

(z) Investment in equity investees <br><br> 

Equity investments represent the Company’s investments in privately held companies and listed securities. The Company applies the equity method to account for an equity investment, in common stock or in-substance common stock, according to ASC 323 “Investment ― Equity Method and Joint Ventures”, over which it has significant influence but does not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control. 
<br><br>
An investment in in-substance common stock is an investment in an entity that has risk and reward characteristics that are substantially similar to that entity’s common stock. The Company considers subordination, risks and rewards of ownership and obligation to transfer value when determining whether an investment in an entity is substantially similar to an investment in that entity’s common stock. 
<br><br>
For other equity investments that are not considered as debt securities or equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and over which the Company neither has significant influence nor control through investment in common stock or in-substance common stock, the cost method is used. 
<br><br>
Under the equity method, the Company’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the equity investee is recognized in the consolidated income statements and its share of post-acquisition movements in accumulated other comprehensive income is recognized in shareholders’ equity. The Company records its share of the results of such equity investees on a one quarter in arrears basis. The excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the underlying equity in net assets of the equity investee represents goodwill and intangible assets acquired. When the Company’s share of losses in the equity investee equals or exceeds its interest in the equity investee, the Company does not recognize further losses, unless the Company has incurred obligations or made payments or guarantees on behalf of the equity investee. <br><br>

Under the cost method, the Company carries the investment at cost and recognizes income to the extent of dividends received from the distribution of the equity investee’s post-acquisition profits. 
<br><br>
The Company continually reviews its investments in equity investees to determine whether a decline in fair value below the carrying value is other than temporary. The primary factors the Company considers in its determination are the length of time that the fair value of the investment is below the Company’s carrying value; the financial condition, operating performance and the prospects of the equity investee; and other company specific information such as recent financing rounds. If the decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity investee is written down to fair value. Impairment charges of RMB71 million, RMB245 million and RMB80 million were recorded in interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, respectively. 
<br><br>
 

(aa) Interest rate swaps  <br><br>

In accordance with ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”, all contracts that meet the definition of a derivative should be recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps are either recognized periodically in the consolidated income statements or in other comprehensive income depending on the use of the interest rate swaps and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting and is so designated. <br><br>

Interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments to hedge against the cash flows attributable to recognized assets or liabilities or forecast payments may qualify as cash flow hedges. During the nine months ended December 31, 2013, the Company entered into interest rate swaps contracts to swap floating interest payments related to certain borrowings for fixed interest payments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain forecasted payments and obligations. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in interest and investment income (loss), net in the consolidated income statements. Amounts accumulated are removed from accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in the consolidated income statements in the periods when the underlying hedged transactions (interest payments) affect the consolidated income statements. The fair value of the hedging instruments held by the Company was nil, nil and RMB40 million as of March 31, 2012, March 31, 2013 and December 2013, respectively, and is recorded in prepayments, receivables and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. <br><br>

Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps not qualified for hedge accounting are reported in consolidated income statements. The estimated fair value of interest rate swaps is determined at discrete points in time based on the relevant market information. These estimates are calculated with reference to the market rates using industry standard valuation techniques. The fair value of the interest rate swaps not qualified for hedge accounting held by the Company was nil, nil and RMB115 million as of March 31, 2012, March 31, 2013 and December 2013, respectively, and is recorded in prepayment, receivables and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The gain on the fair value change of the interest rate swaps not qualified for hedge accounting held by the Company was nil, nil, and RMB115 million for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and nine months ended 2013, respectively and such amounts were recorded in interest and investment income (loss), net in the consolidated income statements.

	<b><a name="T11">(ab) Merchant deposits</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The Company collects deposits from certain merchants on its marketplaces at the beginning of each calendar year. These deposits are initially recorded as a liability by the Company. A pre-determined percentage of the deposits are refundable to a merchant if a certain level of transaction volume is generated by that merchant on the Company’s marketplaces during the period. If the transaction volume target is not met at the end of each calendar year, the relevant deposits will be non-refundable and such portion of the deposits is recognized as revenue in the consolidated income statements. 
<br><br>
 

(ac) Deferred revenue and customer advances  
<br><br>
Deferred revenue and customer advances represent service fees received from customers that relate to services to be provided in the future. Deferred revenue, mainly relating to membership and storefront fees, is stated at the amount of service fees received less the amount previously recognized as revenue upon the provision of the respective services over the terms of the respective service contracts. <br><br>

 

(ad) Treasury shares  <br><br>

The Company accounts for treasury shares using the cost method. Under this method, the cost incurred to purchase the shares is recorded in the treasury shares account on the consolidated balance sheets. At retirement, the ordinary shares account is charged only for the aggregate par value of the shares. The excess of the acquisition cost of treasury shares over the aggregate par value is allocated between additional paid-in capital (up to the amount credited to the additional paid-in capital upon original issuance of the shares) and retained earnings. The treasury shares account includes 33,000,000 ordinary shares issued to subsidiaries of the Company for the purpose of certain equity investment plans for management, which were issued at par value. 
<br><br>
 

(ae) Subscription receivables  <br><br>

The Company made available loans to certain employees of the Company and its related companies in order to finance their exercise of share options and subscription for ordinary shares of the Company (Note 13). The participants of all such loans above have pledged the ownership of their ordinary shares or restricted shares as security for these loans. For accounting purposes, loans outstanding with respect to the exercise of vested options and share subscription are recorded as subscription receivables in equity. Further, unvested options that were exercised are recorded as other current liabilities and they are transferred to equity upon vesting. 
<br><br>
 

(af) Statutory reserves  <br><br>

In accordance with the relevant regulations and their articles of association, subsidiaries of the Company incorporated in the PRC are required to allocate at least 10% of their after-tax profit determined based on the PRC accounting standards and regulations to the general reserve until such reserve has reached 50% of the relevant subsidiary’s registered capital. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the respective board of directors of the subsidiaries. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to the Company in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. During the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, appropriations to the general reserve amounted to RMB373 million, RMB241 million and RMB1,051 million, respectively. No appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund have been made by the Company. 
<br><br>
 

(ag) Convenience translation  
<br><br>
Translations of balances in the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and statements of cash flows from RMB into US$ as of and for the year ended March 31, 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013 are solely for the convenience of the readers and were calculated at the rate of US$1.00=RMB6.2164, representing the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board on March 31, 2014. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at that rate on December 31, 2013, or at any other rate. 
<br><br>
 

(ah) Pro forma information (unaudited)  
<br><br>
The unaudited pro forma balance sheet information as of December 31, 2013 assumes the automatic conversion of all of the outstanding Convertible Preference Shares into 91,243,243 ordinary shares. 
<br><br>
Unaudited pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the periods plus the number of ordinary shares resulting from the assumed conversion of all of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Shares upon the closing of the initial public offering of the Company’s ordinary shares as if such conversion had occurred at the beginning of the periods, or when the Convertible Preference Shares were issued, if later.

	<b><a name="T12">3. Recent accounting pronouncements</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
In July 2012, the FASB issued revised guidance on “Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.” The revised guidance provides an entity the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform a quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The revised guidance is effective for the Company impairment tests performed for the year ending March 31, 2014. This amendment will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
<br><br>
In February 2013, the FASB issued revised guidance on “Comprehensive Income: Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” The revised guidance does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. However, the revised guidance requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. The revised guidance was early adopted by the Company beginning in the year ended March 31, 2012. The revised guidance does not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. <br><br>

In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, “Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists”, which provides that a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit would be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward if such settlement is required or expected in the event the uncertain tax position is disallowed. The new guidance is effective prospectively for the Company for the year ending March 31, 2014. The revised guidance will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

	<b><a name="T13">4. Significant acquisition and equity transactions</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
(a) Initial Repurchase of Ordinary Shares from Yahoo  
<br><br>
In September 2012, the Company completed the repurchase of 523.0 million ordinary shares from Yahoo for a total consideration of US$7.1 billion (RMB44.9 billion) (the “Initial Repurchase”). Out of the total consideration, US$6.3 billion (RMB39.8 billion) was paid in cash and the balance was settled in preference shares of the Company with a liquidation preference amount of US$800 million (RMB5.1 billion) (the “Redeemable Preference Shares”). The shares repurchased from Yahoo were subsequently retired by the Company during the year ended March 31, 2013. Further, the repurchase agreement was amended to provide that upon a qualified initial public offering of the Company meeting certain specified criteria (a “Qualified IPO”), Yahoo must sell or transfer, at the Company’s election, up to 208.0 million ordinary shares (prior to such amendment, 261.5 million ordinary shares) either in the Qualified IPO or to the Company at the initial public offering price per share in the Qualified IPO less certain specified fees and commissions. 
<br><br>
The holders of the Redeemable Preference Shares were entitled to cumulative, semi-annual dividends at a rate of up to 10% per annum, subject to certain adjustments tied to the credit assessment of the Company, with at least 3% per annum payable in cash on pre-determined dividend payment dates and the remaining amount accrued to the liquidation preference. The Redeemable Preference Shares were redeemable at an amount equal to the liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends at the Company’s option at any time, and were mandatorily redeemable at the earlier of the tenth anniversary of the closing date of their issuance or the occurrence of certain specified events. The Redeemable Preference Shares had no voting rights and are not convertible into ordinary shares. For accounting purposes, the Redeemable Preference Shares were classified as liabilities because they are mandatorily redeemable by the Company. Dividends on the Redeemable Preference Shares amounting to RMB271 million and RMB96 million for the year ended March 31, 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, respectively, were recognized as interest expense in the consolidated income statements and credited to accrued expenses, accounts payable and other current liabilities on the balance sheets. Any accrued and unpaid dividends not being settled in cash are to be reclassified to the carrying value of the Redeemable Preference Shares on the pre-determined dividend payment dates. The Redeemable Preference Shares were subsequently redeemed in May 2013. 
<br><br>
Concurrent with the closing of the Initial Repurchase, the Company and Yahoo amended the existing Technology and Intellectual Property Licensing Agreement (“TIPLA”), pursuant to which the Company made a lump sum payment in the amount of US$550 million (RMB3,487 million) to Yahoo. Under the amended agreement, the existing royalty payment arrangement now continues until the fourth anniversary of the effective date of the amendment, unless a Qualified IPO is consummated at an earlier date which would terminate the royalty payment arrangement upon the consummation of a Qualified IPO. The lump sum payment of US$550 million (RMB3,487 million) was recognized as an expense in full immediately.

The Initial Repurchase and the lump sum royalty payment described above were financed by the Redeemable Preference Shares as well as by (i) the issuance of ordinary shares of the Company for total proceeds of US$2.6 billion (RMB16.4 billion); (ii) the issuance of convertible preference shares of the Company with a liquidation preference of US$1.7 billion (RMB10.7 billion) (the “Convertible Preference Shares”), net of issuance cost of RMB157 million; (iii) certain loan facilities obtained by the Company (Note 20); and (iv) existing cash of the Company. 
<br><br>
The Convertible Preference Shares are redeemable at an amount equal to their liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends at the Company’s option at any time subsequent to the first anniversary of the issue date if certain conditions are met, and are mandatorily redeemable on the fifth anniversary of the issue date unless previously redeemed. The holders of the Convertible Preference Shares are entitled to semi-annual dividends at a pre-determined rate until such shares are redeemed. Such dividend rate shall be 2.0% per annum prior to the second anniversary of the issuance date, 5.0% per annum commencing on the second anniversary of the issuance date until the mandatory redemption date, and 8.0% per annum thereafter until the Convertible Preference Shares are redeemed or converted into ordinary shares. The Convertible Preference Shares are convertible at the holder’s option at any time at an initial conversion price of US$18.50 per share subject to certain adjustments, and shall be mandatorily converted concurrently with the closing of a qualified IPO as defined in the Convertible Preference Share purchase agreement. The holders of such shares have no voting rights. The Convertible Preference Shares are classified in the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity on the balance sheets due to their mandatory redemption provision. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Preference Shares are recorded as a reduction of the related proceeds received, and the related accretion will be charged against additional paid-in capital over the period from the issuance date until the mandatory redemption date of such shares. 
<br><br>
As part of the Initial Repurchase, the Company agreed to reimburse Yahoo in the event PRC tax is imposed on the capital gains earned by Yahoo in connection with the Initial Repurchase, equal to the lesser of (i) one half of the excess of (a) such PRC tax liability over (b) certain tax credits which Yahoo can utilize to reduce the amount of tax imposed in the United States, and (ii) US$100 million (RMB622 million). As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013, given the uncertainty in interpretation of the applicability of PRC tax on the Initial Repurchase, the Company has determined that the amount of such payment is not reasonably estimable. As such, the Company has not accrued for any contingent loss in connection with this arrangement as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013.

	<b><a name="T14">(b) Privatization and other share repurchase transactions related to Alibaba.com Limited</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
In May 2012, the proposal to privatize Alibaba.com Limited by way of a scheme of arrangement under Section 86 of the Cayman Islands Companies Law was approved by a sufficient majority of the independent shareholders of Alibaba.com Limited. As part of the privatization, all outstanding shares of Alibaba.com Limited, other than those held by the Company were cancelled in exchange for a cash payment of HK$13.50 per share, for a total amount of RMB15.1 billion. On June 20, 2012, the scheme of arrangement was approved and the listing of the shares in Alibaba.com Limited on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was withdrawn. The rationale for the privatization was to enable Alibaba.com Limited to enhance and realign its strategies with a focus on longer term benefits to its business. Further, all outstanding share-based awards relating to shares of Alibaba.com Limited were cancelled in exchange for an agreement to make a cash payment to the holders of the awards. The Company offered HK$13.50 for each RSU and restricted share and an amount equal to HK$13.50 minus the relevant exercise price for each share option. The agreement provided that the cash payment to former holders of such awards would be made by the Company in accordance with the pre-existing vesting schedules for the original grants of the awards. As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013, the Company had commitments to pay RMB384 million and RMB233 million, respectively, upon vesting of such cancelled share-based awards, of which RMB237 million and RMB165 million was recorded as accrued expenses, accounts payable and other current liabilities on the balance sheets, respectively. During the year ended March 31, 2013, the incremental share-based compensation expense of RMB64 million was recognized in the consolidated income statement in connection with the modification with respect to the cash settlement of the vested awards. Following the privatization, Alibaba.com Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which resulted in a reduction in noncontrolling interest of RMB2,636 million. 
<br><br>
During the year ended March 31, 2012, the Company, directly or indirectly through Alibaba.com Limited, purchased a total of 68,164,000 shares of Alibaba.com Limited at an aggregate consideration of RMB419 million. These transactions were accounted for as equity transactions whereby the excess of purchase price over the carrying value of the related noncontrolling interests acquired were charged to additional paid-in capital and no gains or losses were recognized in the consolidated income statement.

	<b><a name="T15">(c) Restructuring of Payment Services</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Pursuant to the regulations issued by the People’s Bank of China, online payment companies were required to obtain a license in order to operate a payment business in the PRC. These regulations stipulated that the scope of business, the qualifications of any foreign investor and any foreign ownership percentage would be subject to future additional regulations. At the time when the licenses were first issued, no such additional regulations governing foreign-owned payment companies had been put in place. The Company’s management determined that it was necessary for Alipay to qualify itself as a company wholly-owned by PRC nationals in order to obtain a payment license, and, accordingly, the Company restructured its previous ownership of Alipay to eliminate foreign ownership. 
<br><br>
As part of the restructuring, the loan extended for the funding of paid-in capital of Zhejiang Alibaba E-Commerce Co., Ltd. (“Alipay Holdco”) that held the equity interests of Alipay was repaid by the management members in full to the Company during the year ended March 31, 2011. Certain agreements entered into between the Company and Alipay Holdco, such as the loan agreement, the pledge agreement for the same equity interests held by certain management members of the Company, the option agreement to acquire the equity interests in Alipay Holdco when permitted by the PRC laws, among others (the “Agreements”), which allowed the Company to control Alipay Holdco, were also terminated. 
<br><br>
Following the restructuring during the year ended March 31, 2011, the Company has not consolidated or equity accounted for the entities engaging in Payment Services because the Company has no direct and indirect investment in and does not control or have significant influence over Alipay Holdco, Alipay and their subsidiaries. 
<br><br>
During the year ended March 31, 2012, the Company entered into the following commercial arrangements, among others, with APN Ltd., a company owned by two directors of the Company, Yahoo, SoftBank, Alipay, Alipay Holdco, and Alipay Holdco’s equity holders, setting out the mechanism for the future collaboration among the relevant parties relating to the Payment Services: <br><br>


(i) Framework Agreement	<br><br>
Pursuant to the terms of the Framework Agreement, the Company will receive from Alipay Holdco an amount equal to 37.5% of the equity value of Alipay less US$500 million (RMB3,108 million), being the face value of the Promissory Note payable, upon a Liquidity Event as defined in this agreement (the “Liquidity Payment”). Under no circumstances will the amount of the Liquidity Payment plus US$500 million be less than US$2.0 billion (RMB12.4 billion) or more than US$6.0 billion (RMB37.3 billion), subject to certain increases and additional payments if a Liquidity Event does not occur by the sixth anniversary of the agreement. If a Liquidity Event does not occur by the tenth anniversary of this agreement, the Company will have a right to demand Alipay Holdco and Alipay to effect a Liquidity Event as soon as practicable, provided that the equity value or enterprise value of Alipay at such time exceeds US$1.0 billion (RMB6.2 billion). If the Liquidity Event is demanded by the Company, the minimum amount of US$2.0 billion (RMB12.4 billion) described above will not apply to the Liquidity Payment, unless the Liquidity Event is effected by means of a transfer of more than 37.5% of the securities of Alipay. Upon payment of the Liquidity Payment, certain assets and intellectual property related to the operations of Payment Services, which were retained by the Company (the “Retained Business Assets”), will be transferred to Alipay. 
<br><br>
“Liquidity Event” means the earliest to occur of: (a) a qualified initial public offering of Alipay; (b) a transfer of 37.5% or more of the securities of Alipay; or (c) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Alipay. 
<br><br>
In addition, the Company received a non-interest bearing promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) in the principal amount of US$500 million (RMB3,108 million) with a seven-year maturity from APN Ltd. The Promissory Note was secured by a pledge of 50 million ordinary shares of the Company, which were contributed by two directors of the Company to APN Ltd. The Promissory Note formed part of the consideration for the transfer of the Retained Business Assets upon the Liquidity Event and the Promissory Note was payable upon the earlier of the occurrence of the Liquidity Event or December 14, 2018. The Framework Agreement was subsequently amended and pursuant to the terms of the amendment, the Promissory Note was cancelled and the amount of the Liquidity Payment which the Company would be entitled to receive in the event of a Liquidity Event was increased by US$500 million, the principal amount of the cancelled Promissory Note (Note 25). 
<br><br>
(ii) Intellectual Property License and Software Technology Services Agreement  
<br><br>
Under the terms of this agreement, the Company licenses certain intellectual property and provides certain software technology services to Alipay in exchange for a royalty fee and software technology services fee in an amount equal to the costs incurred by the Company in providing the software technology services plus 49.9% of the consolidated pre-tax income of Alipay and its subsidiaries, subject to downward adjustments upon certain dilutive equity issuances by Alipay Holdco or Alipay, but in no case below 30.0% (Note 21). This agreement will terminate at the earlier of (a) the payment of the Liquidity Payment, and (b) such time when termination may be required by applicable regulatory authorities in connection with a qualified initial public offering by Alipay. Income in connection with the royalty fee and software technology services fee, net of costs incurred by the Company, of RMB27 million, RMB277 million and RMB633 million was recorded in other income in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, respectively. 

 <br><br>

(iii) Commercial Agreement  
<br><br>
Under the terms of this agreement, the Company receives payment processing services from Alipay, the fee rate for which is subject to review and approval by the Company’s independent directors designated by Yahoo and SoftBank on an annual basis (the “Payment Processing Fee”) (Note 21). This agreement has an initial term of fifty years and shall be renewable thereafter. If the commercial agreement is required by applicable regulatory authorities to be modified in certain circumstances, a one-time payment may be payable to the Company by Alipay Holdco as compensation for the impact of such adjustment. Expenses in connection with the Payment Processing Fee of RMB1,307 million, RMB1,646 million and RMB1,899 million were recorded in cost of revenue in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, respectively. 
<br><br>
All closing conditions attached to the Framework Agreement and related supplemental arrangements were fulfilled in December 2011. <br><br>

For accounting purposes, the expected fair values of the Liquidity Payment and the Promissory Note are expected to approximate the expected fair values of the Retained Business Assets to be transferred upon payment of the Liquidity Payment, at which time the Intellectual Property License and Software Technology Services Agreement will be terminated. As the Company has entered into this arrangement to pre-determine the mechanism for determining the consideration in the event of a contingent liquidity event that has not occurred, there is no substantive economic value realized or realizable by the Company in these agreements. Accordingly, the Company will account for the Liquidity Payment and the Promissory Note upon the occurrence of the Liquidity Event if the collection of such payments is probable. Further, the Company will account for the royalty and software technology services fee and the Payment Processing Fee in the periods when the services are provided. Such software technology services fee and Payment Processing Fee are expected to approximate the estimated fair values of the services provided. The results of the restructuring of Payment Services were recognized in the consolidated financial statements during the year ended March 31, 2011.

	<b><a name="T16">(d) Other acquisitions</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>


In March 2013, the Company completed an acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interests of HiChina Group Limited (“HiChina”), a partially owned subsidiary of which the Company held 79.1% of the economic interests immediately prior to the acquisition. The total purchase price consisted of cash consideration of RMB335 million, as well as ordinary shares, the fair value of which equaled RMB141 million as of the acquisition date which was recorded as an equity transaction. 
<br><br>
Other acquisitions that constitute business combinations are summarized in the following table: <br><br>
<a href= "pic102.html">Other acquisitions</a><br><br>
A gain of RMB11 million, a loss of RMB4 million and nil were recognized in relation to the revaluation of previously held equity interest related to those step acquisitions in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, respectively. <br><br>

As of March 31, 2012, March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013, the Company assessed the operating and financial targets in connection with previous contingent consideration arrangements, and revised the fair value of the contingent consideration payable. As a result, the Company recognized a decrease in fair value of contingent consideration of RMB28 million for the year ended March 31, 2012, and an increase in fair value of contingent consideration of RMB13 million and RMB203 million in the consolidated income statements for the year ended March 31, 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, respectively. <br><br>

<a href= "pic105.html">Composition of income tax expenses</a><br><br>
Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, the Company is not subject to tax on its income or capital gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by the Company to its shareholders, no Cayman Islands withholding tax is imposed. The Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong were subject to the Hong Kong profits tax rate at 16.5% for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013. 
<br><br>
Current income tax expense primarily represented the provision for PRC Enterprise Income Tax (“EIT”) for subsidiaries operating in the PRC. These subsidiaries are subject to EIT on their taxable income as reported in their respective statutory financial statements adjusted in accordance with the relevant tax laws, rules and regulations in the PRC. 
<br><br>
Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”), the standard enterprise income tax rate for domestic enterprises and foreign invested enterprises is 25%. In addition, the EIT Law provides for, among others, a preferential tax rate of 15% for enterprises qualified as High and New Technology Enterprises. Further, certain subsidiaries were recognized as having status as a Software Enterprise and thereby entitled to enjoy full exemption from EIT for two years beginning with their first profitable year, a 50% reduction for the subsequent three years and a tax rate of 15% thereafter. Furthermore, a duly recognized Key Software Enterprise within China’s national plan can enjoy a preferential EIT rate of 10%. The Key Software Enterprise status is subject to review by the relevant authorities every two years, including by the State Administration for Taxation. The timing of the annual review and notification by the relevant authorities may vary from year to year, and the related tax adjustments in relation to the change in applicable EIT rate are accounted for in the period in which the Key Software Enterprise status is recognized. 
<br><br>
The tax status of the major profitable subsidiaries of the Company with taxable profits is described below: 

 <br><br>

--Alibaba (China) Technology Co. Ltd. (“Alibaba China”), an entity primarily engaged in the operations of the Company’s wholesale marketplaces, was recognized as a High and New Technology Enterprise and Key Software Enterprise during the taxation years of 2011, 2012 and 2013 and was thereby subject to an EIT rate of 10% in respect of these taxation years.  

 
<br><br>
--Taobao (China) Software Co. Ltd. (“Taobao China”), an entity primarily engaged in the operations of Taobao Marketplace, was recognized and New Technology Enterprise and has been granted the Software Enterprise status and is thereby entitled to enjoy an income tax exemption for two years beginning with its first profitable year in 2010, and a 50% reduction for the subsequent three years starting in 2012. Accordingly, Taobao China was exempted from EIT during the taxation year of 2011 and subject to an EIT rate of 12.5% during the taxation year of 2012. Taobao China was recognized as a Key Software Enterprise during the taxation year of 2012 and 2013 and was subject to an EIT rate of 10% during such years.  <br><br>
--Zhejiang Tmall Technology Co. Ltd. (“Tmall China”), an entity primarily engaged in the operations of Tmall, was recognized as a High and New Technology Enterprise and has been granted the Software Enterprise status and is thereby entitled to enjoy an income tax exemption for two years beginning with its first profitable year in taxation year of 2012, and a 50% reduction for the subsequent three years starting in taxation year of 2014. Accordingly, Tmall China was exempted from EIT during the taxation years of 2012 and 2013.  <br><br>

Most of the remaining PRC entities of the Company are subject to EIT at 25% for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013. <br><br>

Pursuant to the EIT Law, a 10% withholding tax is levied on dividends declared by PRC companies to their foreign investors. A lower withholding tax rate of 5% is applicable if direct foreign investors with at least 25% equity interest in the PRC company are incorporated in Hong Kong and meet the conditions or requirements pursuant to the tax arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong. Since the equity holders of the major subsidiaries of the Company are Hong Kong incorporated companies, the Company has used 5% to provide for deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings which are anticipated to be distributed. As of March 31, 2013, the amounts accrued in deferred tax liabilities relating to withholding tax on dividends were determined on the basis that 100% of the distributable reserves of the major subsidiaries operating in the PRC will be distributed as dividends. <br><br>

<a href= "pic106.html">Composition of deferred tax assets and liabilities</a><br><br>
 (i) Others primarily represent accrued expenses which are not deductible until paid under PRC tax laws.   
  (ii) The related deferred tax liabilities as of March 31, 2012, March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013 were provided in full amount in respect of the distributable reserves of Alibaba China, Taobao China, Tmall China and certain other PRC subsidiaries.  <br><br>

Valuation allowances have been provided on the deferred tax assets mainly arising from the tax losses carried forward due to the uncertainty surrounding their realization. Alternatively, if events occur in the future that allow the Company to realize more of its deferred tax assets than the presently recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowances will increase income when those events occur. <br><br>

As of March 31, 2013, the accumulated tax losses of subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong, the United States and a branch established in Taiwan, subject to the agreement of the relevant tax authorities, of RMB792 million, RMB801 million and RMB12 million, respectively, are allowed to be carried forward to offset against future taxable profits. Such carry forward of tax losses in Hong Kong has no time limit, while the tax losses in the United States will expire, if unused, in the years ending March 31, 2019 through 2033. The tax losses in Taiwan will expire, if unused, in the years ending March 31, 2020 through 2022. The accumulated tax losses of subsidiaries incorporated in PRC, subject to the agreement of the PRC tax authorities, of RMB2,321 million as of March 31, 2013 will expire, if unused, in the years ending December 31, 2013 through 2018.

<a href= "pic107.html">Reconciliation of the differences between the statutory EIT rate </a><br><br>
 (i) Expenses not deductible for tax purposes and non-taxable income primarily represent share-based compensation expense, equity-settled donation expense, Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment, interest expense, exchange differences and investment income (loss).  <br><br>
  
   (ii) This amount represents tax incentives relating to the research and development expenses of certain major operating subsidiaries in the PRC. This tax incentive enables the Company to claim an additional tax deduction amounting to 50% of the research and development expenses incurred.

1999 Plan <br><br>

On November 15, 1999, the Company adopted an employee share option plan (the “1999 Plan”). Under the 1999 Plan, incentive share options and share appreciation rights could be granted to employees, and non-qualified share options could be granted to employees, directors and consultants. A total of 138,000,000 ordinary shares were reserved and available for grant and issuance pursuant to the 1999 Plan. All share options granted under the 1999 Plan are subject to dilution protection should the capital structure of the Company be affected by a share split, reverse share split, share dividend or other dilutive action. <br><br>

2004 Plan <br><br>

On May 13, 2004, the Company adopted a new share option plan (the “2004 Plan”) which provided for the issuance of up to 97,200,000 ordinary shares of the Company. The terms of the 2004 Plan were substantially similar to the terms of the 1999 Plan, except that the 2004 Plan did not provide for the issuance of share appreciation rights. In addition to incentive share options and non-qualified share options, the 2004 Plan provided for the issuance of share purchase rights to employees, directors and consultants. <br><br>

2005 Plan <br><br>

On June 1, 2005, the Company adopted a new share option plan (the “2005 Plan”). The maximum aggregate number of shares which were subject to share options issued under the 2005 Plan, as amended, was 129,922,272 shares, plus that number of shares authorized for issuance under the Company’s 1999 Plan and the 2004 Plan, to the extent that the share options or share purchase rights relating to which had not been granted, had expired without having been exercised in full or had become unexercisable. On March 28, 2007, the Company further approved the allocation of an additional pool of 8,000,000 shares to the 2005 Plan. The 2005 Plan had substantially similar terms as the 2004 Plan except that it allowed for repurchase of ordinary shares issued upon exercise of share options and forfeiture of unexercised options granted to participants joining a competitor or terminated for cause. <br><br>

2007 Plan <br><br>

On April 12, 2007, the Company adopted a new share incentive plan (the “2007 Plan”). Options, restricted shares, RSUs, dividend equivalent rights, share appreciation rights and share payments may be granted under the 2007 Plan. The maximum aggregate number of shares which are subject to awards under the 2007 Plan is 56,800,000 shares, plus (i) that number of shares authorized for issuance under all previous plans of the Company but that were not granted under options or share purchase rights pursuant to all previous plans, and (ii) the number of shares that were granted under options or share purchase rights pursuant to all previous plans of the Company but have expired without having been exercised in full or have otherwise become unexercisable. The 2007 Plan had a ten year term and similar terms as the 2005 Plan. 

<br><br>

2011 Plan <br><br>

On March 4, 2011, the Company adopted a new equity incentive plan (the “2011 Plan”). Options, restricted shares, RSUs, dividend equivalent rights, share appreciation rights and share payments may be granted to employees, directors and consultants considered essential to the success of the Company under the 2011 Plan. The maximum aggregate number of shares which are subject to awards under the 2011 Plan is 190,000,000 shares, plus (i) that number of shares authorized for issuance under all previous plans of the Company but that were not granted under options or share purchase rights pursuant to all previous plans, and (ii) the number of shares that were granted under options or share purchase rights pursuant to all previous plans of the Company but have expired without having been exercised in full or have otherwise become unexercisable. The 2011 Plan has a ten year term. The 2011 Plan had substantially similar terms as the 2007 Plan except that the Company is permitted to grant share-based awards to employees of a related entity for which the Company holds 20% or more of the underlying securities and has the sole discretion to settle in cash equivalent to fair market value of the Company’s shares instead of delivery of shares. 
<br><br>
The aggregate number of shares issuable under the 1999 Plan, 2004 Plan, 2005 Plan, 2007 Plan and 2011 Plan is 619,922,272 ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2013, the number of shares authorized but unissued was 77,861,552 ordinary shares. 
<br><br>
Share options and RSUs granted are generally subject to a four-year vesting schedule as determined by the administrator of the plans. Depending on the nature and the purpose of the grant, share options and RSUs in general vest 25% upon the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date or 50% upon the second anniversary of the vesting commencement date, as defined in the grant agreement, and thereafter 25% every year. No outstanding share options or RSUs will be exercisable or subject to vesting after the expiry of a maximum of six years from the date of grant. Early exercise of share options is allowable under all the aforementioned plans; however, any unvested shares are subject to repurchase by the Company at the lower of the original exercise price or the fair market value upon termination of service contracts with the grantees. 
<br><br>
(a) Share options relating to ordinary shares of the Company  
<br><br>
A summary of changes in the share options relating to ordinary shares granted by the Company during the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013 is as follows:<br><br> 
<a href= "pic108.html">Share options relating to ordinary shares</a><br><br>
 (i) Outstanding options as of March 31, 2012, March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013 include 1,805,486, 152,500 and 12,077,421 unvested options early exercised, respectively.  
  (ii) The expected to vest share options are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumptions to total outstanding share options, including early exercised options.  
<br><br>
As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013, 5,282,755 and 693,785 outstanding share options were held by non-employees, respectively. These share options are subject to re-measurement through each vesting date to determine the appropriate share-based compensation expense. 
<br><br>
As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013, the aggregate intrinsic value of all outstanding options was RMB1,628 million and RMB1,264 million, respectively. 
<br><br>
As of December 31, 2013, the aggregate intrinsic value of options that were vested and exercisable and options that were vested and expected to vest is RMB117 million and RMB1,128 million, respectively. 
<br><br>
During the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, the weighted average grant date fair value of share options granted was US$4.33, US$5.20 and US$6.12, respectively, and the total grant date fair value of options vested during the same periods was RMB179 million, RMB219 million and RMB83 million, respectively. During the same periods, the aggregate intrinsic value of share options exercised was RMB1,518 million, RMB1,034 million and RMB1,352 million, respectively. 
<br><br>
Cash received from option exercises under the share option plans, including repayment of loans and interest receivable on employee loans for the exercise of vested options, for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013 was RMB636 million, RMB362 million and RMB1,503 million, respectively. 
<br><br>
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model and the assumptions below: <br><br>
<a href= "pic109.html">the Black-Scholes model</a><br><br>
 (i) Risk free interest rate is based on the yields of United States Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected life of the share options in effect at the time of grant. <br><br> 
  (ii) Expected dividend is assumed to be 0% as the Company has no history or expectation of paying a dividend on its ordinary shares.  <br><br>
  (iii) Expected life of share options is based on the average between the vesting period and the contractual term for each grant.  <br><br>
  (iv) Expected volatility is assumed based on the historical volatility of the Company’s comparable companies in the period equal to the expected life of each grant.

 (i) Restricted shares and RSUs expected to vest are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumptions to total outstanding restricted shares and RSUs.  
<br><br>
As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013, 4,541,945 and 6,888,779 outstanding RSUs were granted to non-employees, respectively. These awards are subject to re-measurement through each vesting date to determine the appropriate share-based compensation expense. <br><br>

(c) Partner Capital Investment Plan relating to ordinary shares of the Company  
<br><br>
During the nine months ended December 31, 2013, the Company offered selected members of the Alibaba Partnership subscription rights to acquire restricted shares of the Company. These rights and the underlying restricted shares are only subject to a non-compete provision but not other vesting conditions (employment or otherwise) and they entitle the holders to purchase restricted shares at US$14.50 per share during a four year period. Upon the exercise of such rights, the underlying ordinary shares may not be transferred for a period of eight years from the date of subscription of the relevant rights. The number of ordinary shares underlying these rights is 18,000,000 shares, of which the rights to subscribe for 5,000,000 shares were offered to a management member of the Company who is holding such rights on behalf of future members of the Alibaba Partnership. 
<br><br>
These rights were subscribed by the participants for cash, of which RMB442 million was received by the Company during the nine months ended December 31, 2013. No share-based compensation expense was recognized in connection with these rights. 
<br><br>
The fair value of each right to acquire restricted shares is estimated on the subscription date using the Black-Scholes model and the assumptions below: <br><br>

<a href= "pic111.html">Partner Capital Investment Plan</a><br><br>
 (i) Risk free interest rate is based on the yields of United States Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected life of the share-based awards in effect at the time of grant.  <br><br>
  (ii) Expected dividend is assumed to be 0% as the Company has no history or expectation of paying a dividend on its ordinary shares.  <br><br>
  (iii) Expected life of the rights is based on management’s estimate on timing of redemption for ordinary shares by the participants.  <br><br>
  (iv) Expected volatility is assumed based on the historical volatility of the Company’s comparable companies in the period equal to expected life of each right.  <br><br>
  (v) Discount for post-vesting sale restrictions applied on the underlying ordinary shares takes into consideration the restriction on sales of eight years.  <br><br>

 

(d) Share subscription program relating to ordinary shares of the Company  
<br><br>
During the year ended March 31, 2012, the Company adopted a share subscription program, pursuant to which selected employees of the Company and a related company were invited to subscribe for 17,010,000 ordinary shares of the Company at a pre-determined price based on the fair market value of the ordinary shares at the time of the offer. The subscription arrangement is only subject to a non-compete provision and does not contain other vesting conditions (employment or otherwise). Such restricted shares are subject to a repurchase provision that is exercisable by the Company upon violation of the non-compete provision by the subsidiaries and expires ratably over a period subject to certain conditions as specified in the relevant agreements. <br><br>

As the subscribers are employees of the Company, share-based compensation expense, measured as the difference between the fair value of the ordinary shares and the subscription price, of RMB166 million was recognized for the year ended March 31, 2012. <br><br>

 

(e) Share options, restricted shares and RSUs relating to ordinary shares of Alibaba.com Limited  
<br><br>
In 2007, Alibaba.com Limited, in preparation for its initial public offering, adopted a share option scheme and a RSU scheme pursuant to which a total of 135,100,000 unissued ordinary shares of Alibaba.com Limited were reserved and made available for grant of share options or RSUs. In 2010, Alibaba.com Limited refreshed the combined scheme limit of such schemes to 156,000,000 ordinary shares of Alibaba.com Limited. 
<br><br>
In 2010, Alibaba.com Limited adopted a share award scheme which was open to directors of Alibaba.com Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Share Award Scheme”). Restricted shares of Alibaba.com Limited awarded under the Share Award Scheme were purchased from the open market and placed in an equity incentive trust. The trustee exercised its power to purchase ordinary shares of Alibaba.com Limited on the market and transferred them to the participants in accordance with the vesting conditions of the Share Award Scheme. Participants were not entitled to dividends on any awarded shares that are not yet vested and transferred to them. The shares of Alibaba.com Limited granted and vested under the Share Award Scheme were insignificant during the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013. <br><br>

The vesting schedule and pattern of share-based awards granted under the schemes of Alibaba.com Limited were generally identical with the plans operated by the Company. Share options were not exercisable after the expiry of a maximum of six years from the date of grant. Following the privatization of Alibaba.com Limited, these schemes were suspended by the Company and all share awards underlying such schemes were cancelled (Note 4(b)). 
<br><br>
A summary of changes in share options granted by Alibaba.com Limited outstanding during the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 is as follows: <br><br>
<a href= "pic112.html">changes in share options</a><br><br>
During the year ended March 31, 2012, the weighted average grant date fair value of Alibaba.com Limited share options granted was HK$6.10 and the total grant date fair value of options vested during the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 were RMB41 million and RMB8 million, respectively. During the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013, the aggregate intrinsic value of share options exercised was RMB42 million and RMB4 million respectively. 
<br><br>
Cash received from option exercises under the Share Option Scheme of Alibaba.com Limited for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 was RMB46 million and RMB3 million, respectively. 
<br><br>
The fair value of each Alibaba.com Limited share option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model and the assumptions below:<br><br>

<a href= "pic113.html"> the Black-Scholes model and the assumptions</a><br><br>
 (i) Risk free interest rate is based on the Exchange Fund Notes issued by Monetary Authority of Hong Kong for a term consistent with the expected life of the share options in effect at the time of grant.  <br><br>
  (ii) Expected dividend is assumed to be 0% as Alibaba.com Limited had no expectation of paying a dividend on its shares.  <br><br>
  (iii) Expected life of share options is based on the average between the vesting period and the contractual term for each grant.  <br><br>
  (iv) Expected volatility is assumed based on the historical volatility of Alibaba.com Limited and the comparable companies in the period equal to the expected life of each grant.  <br><br>
A summary of changes in the restricted shares and RSUs granted by Alibaba.com Limited during the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 is as follows:<br><br>
<a href= "pic114.html">A summary of changes in the restricted shares and RSUs</a><br><br>
Prior to the privatization of Alibaba.com Limited, 27,847,448 share-based awards underlying ordinary shares of Alibaba.com Limited issued by the Company were outstanding as of March 31, 2012. Following the privatization in June 2012, all outstanding share-based awards relating to shares of Alibaba.com Limited were cancelled in exchange for cash payments to the holders of the awards (Note 4(b)). <br><br>

During the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, the Company recognized share-based compensation expense of RMB306 million, RMB152 million and RMB41 million respectively, in connection with all share-based awards relating to ordinary shares of Alibaba.com Limited.

	<hr><br>
	
  

During the nine months ended December 31, 2013, the Company granted 50,000,000 share options to a non-profit organization designated by two members of management of the Company, subject to irrevocable 
<br><br>
instructions to designate and transfer these share options to the separate charitable trusts to be established by these two members of management of the Company. These share options were approved by the directors of the board and such options are not subject to any vesting conditions and are exercisable for a period of four years starting from the grant date. The exercise price of these options is US$25.00 per share and was determined with reference to the fair market value of the ordinary shares of the Company at the time of the grant. For each of the eight years beginning one year after the date of listing of the ordinary shares of the Company on a recognized stock exchange, the charitable trusts are permitted to sell only up to 6,250,000 ordinary shares per year excluding such number of unsold ordinary shares carried forward from previous years. <br><br>

The fair value of each share option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes model and the assumptions below: 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic116.html">the Black-Scholes model and the assumptions </a><br><br>
 (i) Risk free interest rate is based on the yields of United States Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected life of the these options at the time of grant.  <br><br>

  (iii) Expected life of the options is based on management’s estimate on timing of exercise. <br><br> 
  (iv) Expected volatility is assumed based on the historical volatility of the Company’s comparable companies in the period equal to expected life of the options.  <br><br>
  (v) Discount for post-vesting sale restrictions applied on the underlying ordinary shares takes into consideration of the restriction on sales of two to eight years.  
<br><br>
As there are no vesting conditions attached to the above share options, equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 million was recognized in full and recorded in general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended December 31, 2013. <br><br>

	<b><a name="T19">10. Earnings per share</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares, adjusted for outstanding ordinary shares that are subject to repurchase. 
<br><br>
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for basic earnings per share is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including share-based awards, under the treasury stock method. In addition, the computation of the diluted earnings per share assumes the conversion of Convertible Preference Shares. The Company does not have any potentially dilutive securities where their inclusion in the calculation of diluted earnings per share would be anti-dilutive for the periods presented. 
<br><br>
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the following periods:

During the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, gross realized gain of RMB486 million, RMB198 million and RMB120 million and gross realized loss of RMB502 million, RMB145 million and RMB141 million from disposals of investment securities were recognized in the consolidated income statements, respectively. During the same periods, impairment loss of RMB192 million, nil, and nil, respectively, was charged in the consolidated income statements as a result of other than temporary decline in value related to listed equity and fixed income securities. 
<br><br>
As of March 31, 2012, March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013, total unrealized gains of RMB1 million, nil and RMB112 million on available-for-sale investment securities were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, respectively. 
<br><br>
The carrying amount of long-term held-to-maturity investments approximates their fair value due to the fact that the related interest rates approximate rates currently offered by financial institutions for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. <br><br>

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: 

 

     <br><br>
Level 1   -    Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 
   <br><br>
Level 2   -    Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
   <br><br>
Level 3   -    Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. 
<br><br>
Fair value of fixed deposits, corporate bonds, fixed income funds and listed equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments, such as derivative instruments, were valued based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. 
<br><br>
The following table summarizes the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in millions of RMB): <br><br>

<br><br>
During the nine months ended December 31, 2013, the Company completed several investments in equity investees. Details of the significant investments are as follows: 

 <br><br>

(a) Investment in Weibo Corporation (“Weibo”)  
<br><br>
In April 2013, the Company completed an investment in ordinary shares and convertible preferred shares in Weibo representing an 18% equity interest on a fully-diluted basis. Weibo is a leading social media platform in the PRC that is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and the total purchase price consisted of cash consideration of US$586 million (RMB3,645 million) which was payable immediately upon the closing of the transaction. The Company also acquired an option to purchase additional shares which would increase its equity interest to 30% on a fully-diluted basis at a price to be determined based on a formula linked to the future equity valuation of Weibo. Such option is exercisable at the earlier of (i) the consummation of a qualified IPO of Weibo as defined in the shareholders agreement, and (ii) the fifth anniversary from the time of investment. Such investment is accounted for under the cost method. The option has been subsequently exercised by the Company (Note 25). 
<br><br>
 

(b) Investment in UCWeb Inc. (“UCWeb”)  

In May 2013, the Company completed a step acquisition of convertible preferred shares in UCWeb, a leading developer of mobile web browsers in the PRC, for cash consideration of US$506 million (RMB3,130 million) which was paid upon the closing of the transaction. In December 2013, the Company entered into separate agreements to make further investments in UCWeb for cash considerations of US$180 million (RMB1,097 million), and the Company holds approximately 66% of the economic interests after the completion of these step acquisitions. As of December 31, 2013, the total carrying amount in relation to the investment in UCWeb was RMB3,358 million. The investment in convertible preferred shares is accounted for under the cost method given that such shares contain certain terms such as dividend and liquidation preferences over ordinary shares. As a result, the convertible preferred shares are not considered in-substance common stock. 

 <br><br>

(c) Investment in AutoNavi Holdings Limited (“AutoNavi”)  
<br><br>
In May 2013, the Company completed an investment of newly issued ordinary shares and convertible preferred shares in AutoNavi representing a 28% equity interest on a fully-diluted basis. AutoNavi is a provider of digital map content and navigation and location-based solutions in the PRC that is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Stock Market, and the total purchase price consisted of cash consideration of US$294 million (RMB1,818 million) which was payable immediately upon the closing of the transaction. Prior to the first anniversary of the closing date, the Company had the right to require AutoNavi to redeem all of the preferred shares owned by the Company at a price equal to 120% of the then liquidation preference amount in the event of a change of control of AutoNavi as defined in the relevant agreements. For accounting purposes, the investment in convertible preferred shares is accounted for under the cost method given that the convertible preferred shares are not considered in-substance common stock due to the existence of certain terms such as liquidation preference over ordinary shares, and the investment in ordinary shares is accounted for under the equity method given the existence of significant influence. Out of the total purchase consideration, the investment accounted for under cost method amounted to RMB1,285 million and the investment accounted for under equity method amounted to RMB533 million. For the investment accounted for under the equity method, RMB190 million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets and goodwill, RMB26 million was allocated to deferred tax liabilities and RMB369 million was allocated to net assets acquired. The Company has subsequently entered into an agreement to acquire all of the remaining shares of AutoNavi (Note 25). 

 <br><br>

(d) Investment in Zhejiang Cainiao Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. (“Cainiao”)  
<br><br>
In May 2013, the Company made a commitment to invest RMB2,150 million in a newly formed joint venture together with other third parties which owns Cainiao. Cainiao is the operator of a nationwide logistics infrastructure and information sharing system in the PRC, in which the Company owns a 43% equity interest. As of December 31, 2013, the Company invested RMB645 million in Cainiao, and the remaining amount will be invested over a two-year period. For accounting purposes, the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. The Company has subsequently invested an additional RMB935 million and RMB100 million in Cainiao in February 2014 and March 2014, respectively, after which the equity interest in Cainiao held by the Company increased to 48%. 
<br><br>

The Company entered into an agreement during the year ended March 31, 2013 whereby a management member, through a related company acquired the interest in a business aircraft for a cash consideration of US$49.7 million (RMB312 million) which was the original purchase price of the aircraft.

The Company has also entered into a cost reimbursement agreement with the related company to reimburse the maintenance and incidental costs of the aircraft at cost. <br><br>

During the nine months ended December 31, 2013, the Company granted 50,000,000 share options to a non-profit organization designated by two members of management of the Company, subject to irrevocable instructions to designate and transfer these share options to the separate charitable trusts to be established by these two members of management of the Company (Note 9). <br><br>

Other transactions <br><br>

The Company has commercial arrangements with SoftBank and other equity investees to provide and receive certain marketing and other services. For the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, the amounts relating to these transactions were not material. <br><br>

 
22. Restricted net assets  <br><br>

PRC laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Company’s subsidiaries and VIEs incorporated in the PRC only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, the Company’s subsidiaries and VIEs incorporated in the PRC are required to annually appropriate 10% of their net income to the statutory reserve prior to payment of any dividends, unless such reserve have reached 50% of their respective registered capital. In addition, registered share capital and capital reserve accounts are also restricted from withdrawal in the PRC, up to the amount of net assets held in each subsidiary and VIE. As a result of the restrictions described above and elsewhere under PRC laws and regulations, the Company’s subsidiaries and VIEs incorporated in the PRC are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company in the form of dividends. Such restriction amounted to RMB13,543 million and RMB18,408 million as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Even though the Company currently does not require any such dividends, loans or advances from the PRC entities for working capital and other funding purposes, the Company may in the future require additional cash resources from them due to changes in business conditions, funding of future acquisitions and development, or merely to declare and pay dividends or distributions to its shareholders. Except for the above or disclosed elsewhere, there is no other restriction on the use of proceeds generated by the Company’s subsidiaries and VIEs to satisfy any obligations of the Company.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T25">24. Risks and contingencies</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
 (a) The Company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and considered as a foreign entity under PRC laws. Due to the restrictions on foreign investment and ownership on the business related to Internet content provision, telecom value-added services, financial services and others, the Company conducts its business through various contractual arrangements with VIEs that are generally owned and controlled by management members of the Company. The VIEs hold the licenses and approvals that are essential for their business operations in the PRC and the Company has entered into various agreements with the VIEs and their equity holders such that the Company has the right to benefit from their licenses and approvals and generally has control of the VIEs. In the Company’s opinion, the current ownership structure and the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders as well as the operations of the VIEs are in substantial compliance with all existing PRC laws, rules and regulations. However, there may be changes and other developments in PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the Company gives no assurance that PRC government authorities will not take a view in the future that is contrary to the opinion of the Company. If the current ownership structure of the Company and its contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the Company’s ability to conduct its business could be impacted and the Company may be required to restructure its ownership structure and operations in the PRC to comply with the changes in the PRC laws.  <br><br>

 

  (b) The PRC market in which the Company operates poses certain macro-economic and regulatory risks and uncertainties. These uncertainties extend to the ability of the Company to operate or invest in online and mobile commerce or other Internet related businesses, representing the principal services provided by the Company, in the PRC. The information and technology industries are highly regulated. Restrictions are currently in place or are unclear regarding what specific segments of these industries foreign owned enterprises, like the Company, may operate. If new or more extensive restrictions were imposed on the segments in which the Company is permitted to operate, the Company could be required to sell or cease to operate or invest in some or all of its current businesses in the PRC.  <br><br>
 (c) The Company’s sales, purchase and expense transactions are generally denominated in RMB and a significant portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB. The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. In the PRC, foreign exchange transactions are required by law to be transacted only by authorized financial institutions at exchange rates set by the PBOC. Remittances in currencies other than RMB by the Company in the PRC must be processed through the PBOC or other PRC foreign exchange regulatory bodies and require certain supporting documentation in order to effect the remittance. If such foreign exchange control system prevents the Company from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy its currency demands, the Company may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies and the Company’s ability to fund its business activities that are conducted in foreign currencies could be adversely affected.  
<br><br>
 

  (d) Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and investment securities. As of March 31, 2012 and 2013, substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and investment securities were held by major financial institutions located worldwide, including Hong Kong and the PRC. If the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or remain volatile, the financial institutions and other issuers of financial instruments held by the Company could become insolvent and the markets for these instruments could become illiquid, in which case the Company could lose some or all of the value of its investments.  
<br><br>
 

  (e) In the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time involved in legal proceedings and litigation relating to disputes relating to trademarks and other intellectual property, among others. There are no legal proceedings and litigations that have in the recent past had, or to the Company’s knowledge, are reasonably possible to have, a material impact on the Company’s financial positions, results of operations or cash flows. The Company did not accrue any loss contingencies in this respect as of March 31, 2012, March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013 as the Company did not consider an unfavorable outcome in any material respects in these legal proceedings and litigations to be probable.

In its consolidated financial statements, the Company consolidates the results of operations and assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries and VIEs, and inter-company balances and transactions were eliminated upon consolidation. For the purpose of the Company’s stand-alone financial statements, its investments in subsidiaries and VIEs are reported using the equity method of accounting as a single line item and the Company’s share of income (loss) from its subsidiaries and VIEs are reported as the single line item of share of results of subsidiaries and VIEs. Ordinarily under the equity method, an investor in an equity  method investee would cease to recognize its share of the losses of an investee once the carrying value of the investment has been reduced to nil absent an undertaking by the investor to provide continuing support and fund losses. For the purpose of this condensed financial information of parent company, the Company has continued to reflect its share, based on its proportionate interest, of the losses of a subsidiary or VIE regardless of the carrying value of the investment even though the Company is not legally obligated to provide continuing support or fund losses.

Item 6. Indemnification of Directors and Officers 
<br><br>
Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to the public interest, such as providing indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. The registrant’s articles of association provide that each officer or director of the registrant shall be indemnified out of the assets of the registrant against any liability incurred by him or her in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his or her favor, or the proceedings are otherwise disposed of without any finding or admission of any material breach of duty on his or her part, or in which he or she is acquitted or in connection with any application in which relief is granted to him or her by the court from liability for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the affairs of the registrant. 
<br><br>
Under the form of indemnification agreements filed as Exhibit 10.8 to this registration statement, we will agree to indemnify our directors and executive officers against certain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims made by reason of their being such a director or executive officer. 
<br><br>
The form of underwriting agreement to be filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement will also provide for indemnification of us and our officers and directors. 
<br><br>
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

钛媒体注：前几天钛媒体上那篇热文《互联网金融前途多大，需要技术革命的想象力》的作者，长江商学院的知名金融学教授，副院长陈龙教授即将离开长江商学院，今日（10月27日），长江商学院部分师生还将为陈龙践行。	<br><br>
钛媒体多方求证，陈龙将就任阿里巴巴系金融公司，“蚂蚁金融服务集团”首席战略官。目前阿里巴巴集团首席战略官曾鸣，此前也是长江商学院教授。对此，长江商学院创办院长项兵在10月25日的秋季班新生开学典礼上大呼：	<br><br>
老是挖我的优秀人才，马云，我要和你好好谈谈。	<br><br>
曾鸣擅于研究，性格温和，有大格局大视野，其在整个阿里巴巴集团内的地位，这些年来有目共睹。与阿里巴巴集团一样，新成立的“蚂蚁金服集团”也设首席战略官一职，足见蚂蚁金服集团在整个马云阿里系大盘子中的作用。陈龙一直还负责长江商学院的校友校务工作，是长江DMBA（博士班项目）的筹建人，在校友中享有很高的声誉，还被戏称为“小龙龙”。	<br><br>
有分析称，蚂蚁金服集团的未来市值甚至都可以超过如今的阿里巴巴。何为蚂蚁之意，可以参见此前钛媒体文章《被阿里巴巴深刻改变的蚂蚁中国》，以及《阿里金融的蚂蚁系巨无霸版图浮出水面，彭蕾稳坐女主》，随着各项业务、布局的一一浮出水面，一个多牌照、全业务、拥有移动端优势的民间金融巨无霸将横空出世，正步步为营。	<br><br>
10月25日是上届长江商学院21期学员的毕业典礼，也是25期新入学学员的开学典礼，陈龙做了一个关于《中国互联网金融本质与未来》的演讲，作为他在长江的“最后一课”。围绕着互联网金融和供应链金融，陈龙结合中国的经济和金融制度现状，对金融产品在中国的未来做了展望。	<br><br>
以荷兰银行等几个不同案例，陈龙认为，金融诞生的本质就是为商业服务的，随着商业发生根本的变化，金融及支付也会发生根本变化。陈龙教授认为，基于互联网、数字技术和平台的普惠金融大有可为，当前正是发展“不一样的金融”的黄金时代。	<br><br>
以下为陈龙演讲全文，由当天的长江学员整理，首次发表于“盈保倍”，可以结合此前陈龙同样关于互联网金融的上述文章《互联网金融前途多大，需要技术革命的想象力》，（看钛媒体链接：http://www.tmtpost.com/161286.html），能够更好理解：	<br><br>
各位尊敬的嘉宾，亲爱的院长，各位教授们，陪伴我在长江过了几年的同事们，还有这几年陪伴我在长江读书的同学们以及新来的同学们，大家下午好。	<br><br>
今天下午，我的心情特别的复杂，我都不愿想我即将要走的事情，所以一直都没有宣布，因为我总觉得如果我不宣布的话可能就还是长江的一员，真的是这样的感受。我记得非常清楚，三年以前，正好是三年以前在同样的地方，我第一次在长江的，当时是第14、15期结业也是新生的欢迎的会上，我做了第一个金融的这样一个演讲。	<br><br>
当时刚刚在EMBA上课，也就战战兢兢地做了第一个演讲，第一个演讲的题目叫“中国廉价资本时代的终结”，当时我的主题是说，在今后的几年，随着中国金融自由化的推动，股权和债券的融资成本都会上升，现在回过头来看的话好像还是对的。那么今天作为我的第二次的演讲也许是最后一次了，那么我想讲的是另外的，但还是金融的主题，讲的是不太一样的东西，我想讲的是在这个时代做不一样的金融，这可能是一个黄金的时代。	<br><br>
我会从金融的本质和金融的历史来看，就像刚才这个片子讲的一样，我试图把历史融入未来，我还会从中国的经济和金融的制度来看，帮大家去看，我如何来做这样一个结论。	<br><br>
那么我先从金融的本质和金融的历史来看一下，我们在这个时代做不一样的金融会有一个什么样的未来。我先给大家看一份唐朝的小贷的契约，在这个契约里它说有一个居民在吐鲁番，在丝绸之路上挖掘出来的。这个契约是这样写的：有一个居民叫龙会努从另一个居民左崇禧那里收到30匹丝绸，它的月息是4匹丝绸，如果利息不能按月支付，则需每月多支付一匹丝绸；如果左崇禧在特定时候收回丝绸，龙会努必须立即归还；如果借债人讨债，那么他的妻子和孩子和其他列举的人将替他归还债务。如果用现代金融的语言去总结的话，这是什么样的一个小贷呢？它的年化利率是160%；债务可以随时索回，相当于一个活期存款；若展期，利率上调为200%，如果违约有连带的担保。	<br><br>
所以我们知道的现在的小贷、高利贷的霸王条款全部在这个里面。这是唐朝的一份小贷。所以中小企业融资难是自古的一个现象。	<br><br>
为什么会有这样一个现象呢？这就是金融的本质。如果金融要发展的话要克服三方面的问题：1、我们的商业是不是需要金融；2、金融产品是不是有一个渠道，我们融资者是不是有这个渠道得到融资，投资者是不是有渠道找到合适的借款人；3、如果信息有很大的不对称的话，是不是有足够的信息能够降低不对称，增加可信度从而降低融资成本。	<br><br>
这三个方面正好是金融要发展的核心的内容，所以我就讲到互联网金融了，今天我们的互联网金融为什么能够发展，第一是因为商业，新的一代的商业互联网的经济起来了，互联网的经济需要不一样的金融，这是第一个和商业的结合即第一个需求。第二是互联网金融能够给我们两个方面的贡献，一个是渠道的革命，一个是信息本身的革命。前面的龙会努借钱的融资成本是如此的高，第一是他想借钱，他有这个需求但是他没有渠道，他不知道找谁去借钱；其次，别人都不相信他，所以他年化的利率是160%。	<br><br>
但是如果我们能够在渠道上在信息度上给他打一个分，有一个征信度，我们就能够提供新的金融产品，降低融资成本，所以这个方面的结合就是金融的创新。这就是互联网金融的一个本质和它发展的一个逻辑。这个逻辑实际上是自古就有的，商业的逻辑不变，金融的逻辑也不会变，我们会发现商业对金融的需求，由于技术革命而带来的渠道和产品的创新贯穿了整个金融的发展史，那么我相信这次互联网金融带来的前景可能也是类似的。	<br><br>
为了说服大家，我可以讲几个故事，你会发现最主要的金融创新是和我刚才讲的几个主题密切相关的。	<br><br>
第一个，我先讲一个支付的故事和银行的诞生。	<br><br>
第一个现代意义上的银行是阿姆斯特丹银行，它是在1609年诞生的。为什么会有这样一个银行？因为哥伦布航海带来了远洋贸易的商业需求，而荷兰因为造船、物流比较厉害，许多的货物会通过阿姆斯特丹进入欧洲。有了这样一个商业和贸易的需求，它就需要金融去支持。第一个金融的需求是什么呢？是支付和结算。所以阿姆斯特丹银行在1609年就成立了，这个银行只做一件事情，就是支付和结算，它接受各个国家的金属、货币和金银，同时它发放银行的票据、转账、开汇票。这是全世界第一个结算和支付的多边中心，这个中心就只做一件事情就是支付，一直做了70多年。	<br><br>
由于金融和商业的结合，它让阿姆斯特丹成为全世界最大的一个金融中心。大量的钱和贸易通过阿姆斯特丹进入欧洲，当它做了70多年支付以后，它自然从1683年开始为客户提供贷款和信托，因为它有很多钱，它能够给它的客户提供更多的金融的服务，这就是商业――支付――信贷这样一个整个的过程，最后的结果是阿姆斯特丹成为17世纪世界上最大的贸易中心和金融中心。	<br><br>
300多年后，有一个公司叫阿里巴巴，它做了淘宝和淘宝商城，它做的是天上的贸易不是海上的贸易，它为了做天上的贸易需要天上的金融去支持它，为了做这个事情它被迫去做支付宝。它一开始是做支付宝，由于支付宝和贸易的结合，淘宝成为了今天的电商，全世界最大的领先的电商。今天阿里巴巴之所以能够去美国去上市及有着2000多亿美金的估值，这和支付宝是完全分不开的。当你做了支付，就像阿姆斯特丹一样，慢慢就会做各种信贷、投资产品，比如说余额宝，比如说阿里小贷，所以商业和金融的逻辑是不变的。	<br><br>
这个逻辑不只是中国的阿里巴巴，如果放眼全世界就会发现，很多非银行机构都在进军网络的支付。谷歌在2011年推出了谷歌钱包；亚马逊提供了基于kindle的支付和转账服务；苹果这个月刚刚推出了基于iPhone和iPad的apple pay――苹果支付，当时它的口号：苹果像用iPod整合音乐行业资源一样整合支付行业。所以互联网公司、非金融机构进军金融是国际上的大势。美国的一个零售的联盟包括沃尔玛、CVS、埃克森美孚（美孚也在做自己的移动支付的体系）等大公司正在建立一个移动支付体系；美国的三家电讯巨头（AT&T、T-Mobile和Verizon）正在联合建立自己的移动支付和虚拟钱包，这代表的是金融业做的一个支付和垄断的终结。	<br><br>
为什么他们都要做支付，因为这个时代需要精的金融产品。第一个重要产品是支付，不但是支付，而且它满足了我刚才讲的金融本质的几个条件，它除了做支付，还提供了渠道，提供了信息，因为有了渠道和信息，我们可以提供更多的精准的服务，包括商业的服务和金融的服务，所以它是金融的第一步，以这个为基础我们可以打造出一个金融的王国。	<br><br>
刚才讲的是银行的诞生，我再讲一下投行的诞生。	<br><br>
美国在18世纪建立以后，过了20多年，在1812年跟英国打仗（这个战争可以说推动了加拿大的建立）。当时美国打仗需要钱，自己需要1600万美金，但是只能够融到600万美金。美国就像中国唐朝的居民龙会努一样没有渠道，不知道找谁去借钱，也没有很好的征信的记录。在这样的背景下，当时有三个纽约和费城的商人他们就说，好吧，我们来帮你做这件事情。于是，“承销”这个词就第一次出现了。这三个商人说，美国政府你可以发一个债券，1块钱美金的债券呢，我以4毛钱美金买进，然后他们转身8毛2就卖出去了。所以第一笔的承销费用美国政府1000万美金的面值只融到了400万的美金，而这个承销费用是420万的美金，所以美国当时和龙会努一样，面对的是高利贷，是因为他没有征信没有渠道，这个是第一个例子。这个例子告诉我们投行的本质。大家都看到了，什么是投行呢，投行就是承销不定性的金融的产品，能够有渠道进行这样的担保，这就是投行的主题。	<br><br>
那么又过了五六十年，到了1864年，这个时候美国又打仗，南北战争。这个时候美国政府又需要借钱，借20年-30年的钱，但是它不好借钱啊。在这个一个背景之下呢，有一个叫库克的小银行家，他说我来帮你做这个事情。他为什么做这个事情呢？在当时正好有一个科技的革命。在当时这个革命叫做“电报”，这就是当时的高科技。所以这个叫库克的银行家做了几个事情，他把北方的大部分的小城市的代理机构都做了登记，寻找渠道；第二他第一次通过打电报的方式去卖这样一个金融的产品，去做销售。他降低每份国债的面值，这样的话潘恳部梢月蚬债，他也可以通过各种广告通过各种渠道去宣传。他最后做的这个事情，因为电报的威力成果巨大，他卖了10个亿以上的美金的国债，而且他只是平价卖出，只收了千分之一的承销费，几乎是免费做的。他需要达到的什么东西呢，他只需要每个人在购买美国国债的时候，通过他的银行转一道手，这样他就得到了客户，用现在的话来说这就叫导入流量，用一个免费的方式去做这个销售。通过导入流量把自己的投资机构做大，这就是电报的威力。	<br><br>
大家可以看到科技的进步带来了金融的创新，带来了投行的创新。我刚才已经讲了银行和投行，我现在再讲第三个例子叫消费者信贷。在上个世纪初渐渐的有了消费者信贷就是信用卡，你如果想一下，信用卡这个东西几乎是不可思议的。因为人类几千年以来的信贷都是典当，如果你在我这里压100块钱，给你50块钱，基本上是不亏钱的，所以开发一个金融产品是无担保的小贷实际上是一个非常有风险、很难做的事情，原来是完全没有这个市场的。他们是怎么做起来的呢？	<br><br>
当时是正好中产阶级上升，需要消费者信贷，但是又没有征信，因为有信息不对称。我们做不了这个金融创新，它怎么办呢？这个时候就开始有了信用的评级――征信这样的机构。在美国二战以后，有大批的军人退役，存在着消费者信贷这样一个刚需，在这个大背景之下，第一个致力于信用评级的公司Fair Issac――提供的服务叫做FICO，到现在为止还是全世界最权威的个人征信的评级公司――在1956年诞生了。	<br><br>
由于这样的一个评级，就开始有了这个征信，所谓的征信，就是把各种各样的数据，也是我们今天讲的大数据结合起来，给你一个比较准确的评级，去降低信息的不对称。由于有了这个背景，到了1958年，第一张银行的信用卡就产生了，但是在产生之后，规模还是很小，因为它当时很难去标准化，去适合各种不同的人群。所以，信用卡真正的繁荣是60年代，因为有了计算机的使用，在这个背景之下，我们在收集数据和处理大数据的能力大大的提高了。	<br><br>
由于这个背景，Visa，还有Master卡，这些信用卡联盟的公司真的开始做大了，终于就产生了现在广泛推行信用卡。大家可以看到，科技的进步、计算机的产生推动了征信，推动了渠道，推动了新的金融产品，这个就叫做消费者信贷，叫做信用卡。	<br><br>
那么，把这些例子都讲了之后，我们就不吃惊现在的互联网公司为什么会去做互联网金融了。	<br><br>
我们知道，在过去的几年，现在的阿里巴巴已经上市了，在08年的时候，其实淘宝只有大概1千亿美金的交易额，到12年就做到了1万亿美金，为什么这样去做呢？淘宝它后来总结了自己的经验，他们发现，其实我们是做了一个事情，是全世界金融危机之后，把、沿海和东部的制造业和产业过剩的生产能力，中国西部和中西部三四线（城市）的80后和90后的刚需结合起来，我们通过这个渠道，进行互联网的革命，用这个渠道把他们结合起来了。	<br><br>
这就是淘宝做到了的事情，它其实做的事情就是把中国构架出一个在互联网上的、国内的、统一的大市场，这就是电商带来的革命。现在在做电商的人都说，互联网化下的电商的未来，是消费者推动零售、批发、品牌商生产和原材料，是C2B的构架。与此同时，大家想一想，如果产业链、供应链都是在网上，会大大的降低信息的不对称，那么像唐朝龙会努这样的一个居民，就能够得到很好的、基于征信的金融产品，所以供应链金融会有一个非常大的前景，就像当年的消费者金融一样。	<br><br>
我们刚才讲的是从金融的本质以及金融史的角度出发来看这个不一样的金融的未来。我现在想从中国的经济金融制度来看这个未来。那么大家都知道，中国这个几十年经济就是资本的国有化，就是所谓的计划经济。计划经济，它当年就是取消市场，取消企业私人的产权，在宏观的政策上是管制利率和汇率，那么管制利率和汇率就是让中国所有的资本和资源都向中国的国有资本倾斜，是去支持中国重工业发展这样一个前景。当然，这样一个机制是非常糟糕的，它最后的结果是让中国成为消费短缺的经济体，城乡差距很大，因为它剥削农业。在金融体系里面，中小企业融资难，金融消费者找不到融资产品的这样一个现象。这是过去几十年，建国以来一直如此，那么到现在，依然是这样的。整个中国市场的金融体系，还是向中国的国有资本去倾斜的，而且它也不会非常快地去改变的。	<br><br>
我们知道这个央行，周小川在推动中国私有化，他说两年之内会推动，实现利率的自由化，但是它是不可能这么快就实现的，为什么呢，大家想一想，中国现在国企和央企是赚钱的，但是这个赚钱是实际上是因为它们对行业的垄断以及对融资成本的低廉而得到的。如果中国的融资成本上升几个点，它就可以抹平中国的国企和央企的利润。所以中国的金融的自由化取决于中国国企的混合经济的改革和中国城乡统一的改革。所以这资源倾斜的改革如果不能成功的话，中国以市场为核心去决定这个要素的价格以及分配机制是不可能完成的。	<br><br>
那么这说明什么呢？我们知道，中国经济的发展是需要金融体系来支持的，没有一个发达国家是没有一个发达的金融体系的。但中国只是一个落后的资源倾斜的金融体系，这样一个金融体系不会很快地改变。如果它改变的话国有资本会出事的。所以它改变一定是以中国的国有经济的改革为主，这也是十八大的主旋律。那么这样的话，由新技术革命带来的给新金融消费者的服务――就是我说的不一样的金融――它就会有一个非常大的前景。这就是中国经济和金融的体系所决定的。	<br><br>
再给大家看一张图画，这我们知道，这个图画是什么东西呢，这个图画的是过去的几十年中，消费占GDP的比例。美国的话，大家可以看到现在大概是70%左右，中国的消费占GDP的比例只是35%左右，这正好是美国的一半。这两个国家正好相反，美国是消费太高了，中国则是消费太低了。	<br><br>
消费太低它一定要上升，所以中国必须从投资拉动经济向消费拉动经济去转型。所以我想讲的是，中国长期来说一个非常大的未来是什么呢，是消费升级、服务升级、体验经济、老年化、大健康。所以如果你还有钱要投资的话，一个非常大的前途应该是和服务业、消费和大健康相关的整个的产业链。包括相关的交通、物流和消费者信贷和金融的服务，再加上互联网革命这样一个因素。所以我觉得三个关键词，一个是互联网，一个是消费者，一个是金融。它们这个结合有一个非常大的未来。	<br><br>
那么我借用两分钟讲一下一些金融产品的未来前景。如果你看一下，你会发现美国人的金融资产大概只有15%的钱放在银行里，中国可能倒过来，85%的钱放在银行里。如果一般家庭的存款会有一半从银行里跑出来，如果非金融机构、企业在银行里的存款能有20%的互联网化的话，加起来就是三四十万亿的这样一个市场的空间，所以理财，包括互联网理财是一个非常大的一个方向。我刚才提到的消费者信贷，那么中国现在人均持有信用卡大概是0.3张，美国的话，就是每个持卡人大概有7张，如果中国每个持卡人大概能有人均2张的话，大概5、6倍的涨幅了，那么就是有十几万亿的规模的消费者信贷这样一个市场没有被开发的。	<br><br>
再看一下这个小微企业和个体户对中国GDP贡献大概是60%这样一个份额，所以你看一下13年底的GDP的话，它们的贡献大概有34万亿的这样一个份额。但我们知道中国这样小微企业和个体户基本在银行里是借不到钱的，所以这是一个待开发的市场。但是你要去开发他的话一定是需要大数据的支持，那么在这个时代是经济的革命就会带来这样一个便利。还有保险，那么我就不多说了。	<br><br>
最后一点想提的就是这个网络银行。	<br><br>
网络银行，下面第一个例子是荷兰的ING，这个网络银行是，看它的数字是它的运营成本，可以看到它跟常规银行相比是最低的，为什么呢，因为它不需要线下的这些分店去揽存，所以它的成本是最低的。但是我认为在中国经营以后的网络银行，我们知道现在腾讯的微众银行，还有阿里巴巴这个银行也申批下来了,那么这些中国的网络银行更是由一个前景。为什么呢，因为它线下去开一些分行去揽存的话，还有很大的一个商业和支付的场景已经作为基础了，所以它不但是像国外的银行是一个渠道的革命，它还是一个信息的革命。我觉得是一个非常大的突破，很多人已经在用网络支付去消费，进行电商的购买，所以我们以这个基础，可以提供很多精准的金融产品的服务。所以我认为中国的网络银行也是非常有前景的。	<br><br>
我刚才已经从金融的本质和金融史的角度讲了一下，那么我想讲的还是这三个点，金融的本质。第一个是新商业的机会将带来对金融的需求，就像互联网时代带来的新商业机会也会带来新的对金融的需求，那么技术革命它往往会带来金融创新，带来新的金融市场。就像我们当年无法想象的消费者信贷一样，我们可能也无法想象一个新的金融市场的革命。由技术革命带来的金融市场的产生，这个技术革命可以带来渠道的革命，也可以由于对信息的大数据收集而带来征信，带来新的金融产品。所以中国的互联网，尤其是由商业平台的互联网，这个平台因为它有了渠道和大数据，它能带来很多的金融创新，所以在这样一个创新的基础上，基于互联网，基于数字技术和平台的普惠金融，我认为，它会有一个非常大的前途。	<br><br>
大家想象一下，中国一般的老百姓都不知道买什么样的一个投资产品，在中国无数的中小企业和一般的消费者，他需要信贷，也没有这样一个金融工具的提供，所以在这个时代我觉得做不一样的金融，就是互联网金融，我觉得这是一个黄金的时代。那么我们长江的校训，来自我们项院长的“取势、明道、优术”。	<br><br>
我刚才的发言其实就像是“取势”，如果我们是没有翅膀的猪，想飞翔的话最好的办法就是知道风口在什么地方，然后就是到这样一个风口去。	<br><br>
这就是我今天想和大家分享的对互联网不一样的金融的理解，谢谢大家！	<br><br>

互联网金融前途多大，需要技术革命的想象力<br><br>

钛媒体   2014-10-19 <br><br>

钛媒体注：谈互联网金融的未来，不得不先看看互联网金融的本质和逻辑。长江商学院副院长陈龙在10月18日的蚂蚁金融分享日上做了一个演讲，非常清晰的厘清了互联网金融的逻辑，并以详细的案例，讲清楚了中国经济和金融制度的本质与未来。全文由《商业价值》记者刘泓君根据现场整理，钛媒体编辑先提取了几个要点：<br><br>

1、如果要看金融的未来，就要知道它的大的图景在什么地方？中国的经济增长，一定需要金融的增长支持它，金融就像市场经济的血液一样。在中国十八大以后，将来真的要释放生产力和提高生产力，金融一定要大的发展。但现状是一个资源倾斜的金融体系，它不会非常快的改变，为什么？因为如果把资源倾斜的政策取消了，比如中国的金融自由化、利率自由化发生很快的话，国有企业就受不了了。
<br><br>
2、美国是最大的消费国，中国的消费只占了GDP的30%多，美国是70%。美国为了支持它的消费，储蓄率甚至到零了，通过借债，通过不储蓄，在消费，不能持续就发生金融危机。现在中国经济的现状，为什么那么多的行业产能过剩，因为消费国已经出了问题，生产国必须调整，我们是一个最大的生产国。这是一个周期性的因素，长期来说，这样一个中美失衡的情况必须调整，怎么调整？中国的消费必须有很大的提高，所谓的消费拉动的经济，这是我们中国的未来。
<br><br>
3、金融的本质，如果将来看20年，有三个关键词：互联网、消费、金融。所以，科技的进步，加上金融，再加上中国消费的前景，有一个非常大的前途。金融生态可总结为三句话：金融产品也是卖产品的；产品是有不定性，是有风险的；卖产品的机构也是有道德风险的，需要被监管。这基本上把金融的生态圈最本质的东西讲清楚了。
<br><br>
4、互联网金融的未来，可以在三大案例中得到支撑。案例一：支付是中国弯道超车的机会；案例二：技术推动的投行变革；案例三：大数据下的征信体系。<br><br>
5、基于上述要点，互联网金融的未来能做多大，很需要技术革命的想象力。金融史的各种产品告诉我们，第一，商业发展本来就会对金融产生需求。同时，技术进步会带来金融创新，这个创新又会带来新的金融需求。例如，在信用卡这样的金融产品产生以前，你是无法想象消费者信贷的。所以，我们有了新的科技会带来新的金融创新，它的体量可以是非常大的，但是现在可能没有足够的想象力。
<br><br>
技术革命有两个好处：渠道，把生产和需求联系起来了。由于大家做事情，就有了信息，有了信息就可以有征信，有了征信就可以有金融。
<br><br>
6、基于此，我们可以看到未来中国金融产品的六大机会：理财产品；消费者信贷、小贷、保险、供应链金融、网络银行。
<br><br>
 

以下是《商业价值》记者刘泓君根据现场演讲整理的全文，小标题为钛媒体所加：
<br><br>
我今天主要讲的不是产品本身，主要讲的是互联网金融未来的逻辑，因为金融是有本质的，把这个逻辑讲清楚了，可以帮我们理解未来。
<br><br>
从宏观的角度怎么看互联网金融的未来？
<br><br>
第一，从中国的经济和金融制度所理解的未来。
<br><br>
在这里先讲一本书，叫《21世纪的资本论》，刚刚在中国开始上架，这本书出来以后得到全世界经济学家的追捧，大家都在热议这本书。为什么会有人讲资本论呢？因为每一个国家，每一个经济制度都有一个资本论，所谓的资本论就是资本和劳动力如何做一个有效的结合，才能够去推动经济的增长。在这个过程中，资本和劳动者的分享是不是公平，效率和公平是每个经济体都面临的问题，所以，每个国家都有资本论。马克思会说资本家和劳动者是搞不好的，劳动者有一天会起来把资本家给埋葬。Piketty（备注：《21世纪资本论》作者）也觉得资本家和老东家是搞不好的，所以要对资本家征收重税。<br><br>

我写了一篇文章叫“21世纪的资本论应该怎么写”，我讲到了中国的资本论应该怎么写，因为每个国家都是有资本论的。如果讲中国的资本论，可以说在建国以后，前30年计划经济，计划经济最核心的东西是资本的国有化，为了完成它的追求重工业发展的目标，资本基本上国有化了，产权的政策上，取消了企业的私人的产权；在市场的政策上，取消了市场，统购统销。用压低各种生产要素价格的方式，把所有的资源向重工业的发展倾斜。在宏观的政策上，利率管制，汇率管制，压低利率，压低企业的融资成本，把所有的资源都向重工业的发展去倾斜，这是中国前30年的历史。<br><br>

后来出现了消费短缺的经济，我们的福利非常低下，中国是一个城乡差别非常大的国家，在金融体系里，中小企业融资难，金融消费者找不到投融资产品的现象非常普遍的存在。中国原来是没有银行的，因为金融体系是中国国策的一个取款机，即便后来有了商业银行，一直到今天为止，中国的商业银行很有像政策银行的味道。<br><br>

如果要看金融的未来，要知道它的大的图景在什么地方？中国的经济增长，一定需要金融的增长支持它，金融就像市场经济的血液一样。在中国十八大以后，将来真的要释放生产力和提高生产力，金融一定要大的发展。但现状是一个资源倾斜的金融体系，它不会非常快的改变，为什么？如果把资源倾斜的政策取消了，比如中国的金融自由化、利率自由化发生很快的话，国有企业就受不了了。<br><br>

这个倾斜会一直存在，存在很长的时间。我为什么要提这个问题？这就是我们今天关心的一个东西，在现在这个时代，新技术带来的给金融消费者服务有非常大的前途。金融消费者包括了中小企业，也包括了在座的各位的个人的金融消费者，因为资源倾斜的关系，原来投融资产品非常少，由于新技术、由于互联网，有非常大的前景，而现在的金融体制是不满足这个前景的。<br><br>

讲一下宏观。这个图告诉我们金融的未来在哪里？<br><br>

这个图讲的是中国和美国消费占的GDP的比例，中国越来越低，而美国是越来越高，在过去的20多年中，中国和美国的经济是一个相互依存的经济，美国是一个非常大的消费国，甚至可以说是消费过度了，而中国是一个非常大的生产国，支持它的消费。
<br><br>
由于美国是最大的消费国，中国的消费只占了GDP的30%多，美国是70%。美国为了支持它的消费，储蓄率甚至到零了，通过借债，通过不储蓄，在消费，不能持续就发生金融危机。现在中国经济的现状，为什么那么多的行业产能过剩，因为消费国已经出了问题，生产国必须调整，我们是一个最大的生产国。<br><br>

这是一个周期性的因素，长期来说，这样一个中美失衡的情况必须调整，怎么调整？中国的消费必须有很大的提高，所谓的消费拉动的经济，这是我们中国的未来。<br><br>

长期来说，中国是消费拉动，如果你还有钱需要投资，应该投资的是消费升级，服务升级，体验经济，老年化，投资的应该是和服务业、消费相关的整个产业链，包括物流、交通、信贷、金融服务、互联网。<br><br>

未来的金融本质，有三个关键词和三句话<br><br>

如果将来看20年，有三个关键词：互联网、消费、金融。所以，科技的进步，加上金融，再加上中国消费的前景，有一个非常大的前途。
<br><br>
下面从金融的本质谈一下，我们可以看到的未来。唐朝的小贷的契约，这是从以前的丝绸之路挖掘出来的。这里面有一个居民从另外一个居民左崇喜那里收到30匹丝绸，月息4匹丝绸，如果利息不能按时付每月多付一匹丝绸。
<br><br>
总结一下，现在各种高利贷的因素全都在里面了，小贷是自古以来都有的现象。为什么会有这样一个现象呢？这跟金融的本质是相关的。如果我们要知道金融的未来，就要知道金融的本质。<br><br>

金融的本质可以从两个角度理解：功能本质和商业本质。功能的本质很简单，第一个是做支付的，最老的金融产品是钱，后来有了信用卡、储蓄卡、银行卡。第二个功能是投融资，把钱作为穿越时间和空间的传导，这个传导经常不是一对一的，你还得把钱都存到银行里去，有些时候是穿越期限的，存是短期的，贷是长期的。第三个功能是保险。
<br><br>
如果要知道金融的未来，更应该理解它的商业的本质，三句话：
<br><br>
1、金融产品是卖产品和服务的。任何一种商业行为都是提供一种产品和服务的，当你提供产品和服务，一定要三个东西要注意，什么样的产品？通过什么渠道卖产品？有没有品牌卖这个产品？任何一种商业行为都离不开这三个角度。也因此，马上能知道互联网跟金融是有关系的。为什么呢？互联网第一个是渠道的革命，金融产品不神秘，还是一个产品，是卖产品和服务的，有渠道的问题，有产品的问题，有品牌的问题。<br><br>

2、金融产品跟一般的产品不太一样，水是一种产品，金融产品跟这个产品可能还有一点不一样，不一样的地方在什么呢？金融产品有不定性，金融产品本来反映了商业的风险，代表了商业的活动，它本身是有风险的。还有立项选择的风险，在金融里面都知道，最想借钱的人你是不能借钱给他的，因为他可能把钱拿过去不给你了。再一个风险是道德风险，你把钱借给对方以后，你可能控制不了他。由于这些风险，金融的产品跟一般的产品不一样，它是一个有风险的产品。而且这个风险往往是滞后的，现在不会发生，可能以后才会发生出来。由于有这个特点，就需要中介做风险的界定、控制和定价，这是金融机构最核心的竞争力。倒过来说，互联网除了是一个渠道的革命，另外一个可以做的是，因为有了互联网，有了平台，有了信息，有了数据，可以大大的降低这个不定性，可以产生新的金融产品。
<br><br>
3、金融机构作为一个中介，需要对金融产品的不定性做一个甄别，但是金融机构本身也是有道德风险的，风险会不会出事呢？可能一两年以后才知道，我现在卖掉，钱就可以拿到了。金融中介也是需要被监管的，这就是金融的生态圈。在这个生态圈里，有金融的消费者，有金融机构，就是卖这个产品的中介，还有监管者。这三者之间有一个很紧密的关系，如果你要推动金融的发展，需要整个生态圈的健康的发展。<br><br>

再总结一下，三句话：金融产品也是卖产品的、产品是有不定性，是有风险的，卖产品的机构也是有道德风险的，需要被监管。基本上把金融的生态圈最本质的东西讲清楚了。<br><br>

三大案例看金融创新的机会<br><br>

案例一：支付是中国弯道超车的机会<br><br>

我们怎么用它？如果你想知道一个金融产品能够发展多远，一般来说，金融的不定性越大就越难被互联网化，不定性越小的金融产品发展的越快。这是一个原理。你如果想知道互联网金融的东西能够发展的多快？第一个问题是这个东西跟商业的结合有多紧密，商业是不是需要这个产品，是不是需要一个商业的场景。如果已经有一个商业的平台，再去做金融和从头去做金融是不一样的，因为你本来有一个商业的需求，它会发展的更快。<br><br>

互联网金融能够给我的产品带来哪些贡献？第一，新的互联网对渠道的贡献，原来在线下卖产品，现在是网上了。第二，除了渠道，还能带来新的信息，这个信息可以帮我们甄别风险，降低不定性，从而带来新的金融产品。
<br><br>
我讲几个距离的案例。第一个例子，支付，互联网支付是发展的最快的产品，为什么呢？很简单，它符合了两个原理：一是它跟商业的结合是最紧密的，在互联网的时代就需要互联网的支付。阿里巴巴之所以有今天，跟支付宝是分不开的，网上的交易就需要支付宝，它就发展起来了。二是支付相对的不定性是比较少的，因为买卖双方已经决定要做这个事情了，它的不定性比较小，唯一需要的就是便捷和安全，如果把这两方面做到了，它就可以去发展。
<br><br>
另外，它跟商业的结合是最紧密的。跟商业结合最紧密的道理，自古以来都是这样的。我可以很快的提两个故事，比如说现代的银行，如果看金融的历史，现代银行的产生就是因为支付。第一个现代意义上的银行是阿姆斯特丹银行，在荷兰，荷兰的船造的很好，很多货物通过阿姆斯特丹运到欧洲。<br><br>

如果你有很多的贸易，尤其是国际贸易，一定是要去支付和结算。由于这样一个背景，现代意义上的第一个银行阿姆斯特丹银行就诞生了。这个银行只做一件事情，就是支付和结算，一直做了70多年，到1683年的时候，因为支付和结算，把阿姆斯特丹的贸易做的非常发达，就像支付宝把淘宝做的非常旺盛一样的。在这之后，阿姆斯特丹银行开始提供小贷。所以，当支付做了一段时间以后，就会提供别的金融的服务。<br><br>

第二个例子，山西票号。<br><br>

现在想起山西是一个资源的大省，其实山西是以前的金融之王，因为山西离原来的边境是比较近的，在名朝的时候，有个东西叫盐运，山西产盐，又在边境上，就可以做盐的贸易。做了贸易以后，就需要支付的支持了，他们就有了山西票号，1823年第一个山西票号叫日盛昌，后来有乔家大院，先是有贸易，后来有了支付。山西票号上个世纪初的时候，全体衰落了。衰落的原因，非常重要的原因是清政府自己成立了银行，把结算和支付拿过去了，山西票号的核心竞争力就慢慢萎缩了，加上国力不济，它就衰落了。
<br><br>
中国的互联网支付比西方做的还快，我在北美生活了17年，在美国做教授的时候写支票写了好多年，现在美国人还在写支票。中国的支付已经领先美国了，我有时候开玩笑说，中国的互联网金融一定会领先美国，为什么呢？因为中国的互联网不够发达，中国的金融不够发达，注定了中国的互联网金融会更发达，说起来有点奇怪，但就是这样的，因为你可以弯道超车，支付是一个很明显的例子。习惯了中国的支付，到美国就会觉得很不方便。<br><br>

实际上现在很多的互联网公司都在做支付，谷歌从01年就推出了谷歌的钱包，苹果最近刚刚推出了基于苹果手机和iPad的手机支付，到下个月会推出。这是一个非常有影响的东西，现在苹果的口号是，要像ipod整合音乐一样去整合支付行业。美国零售的联盟在建立移动支付的体系。
<br><br>
我想说的是，互联网公司非金融机构进军支付是世界范围内的现象，不要觉得只有银行才能做，只有金融机构才能做。互联网公司由于有商业场景这个平台，做支付是一个非常自然的选择。所以，支付是走的最快的。在这块，中国多少已经领先于西方的一些国家了。
<br><br>
支付之所以重要，除了是支付本身，另外还是数据的收集。当我们在做支付的时候，就知道了你支付的习惯和信息，我们可以很精准的服务。支付代表了两个东西：数据和支付。有了这个基础，我们就可以提供更多的金融的服务。比如余额宝。有了支付以后，就可以提供别的金融的服务。<br><br>

案例二：技术推动的投行变革<br><br>

下面讲投行的故事。原来是没有投行的，在1812年的时候，美国和英国打了一场仗，它直接导致了加拿大的独立，当时美国政府需要融1600万美金的现金，只融了600万，有了1000万的缺口。当时是没有投行这个东西的，当时到了在纽约的商人，商人说帮着融，他们就把1000万美金面值的国债买进来。<br><br>

这就是投行的本质，它是销售一种有不定性的金融产品，它要承销，说担保可以做这个事情，而且我有渠道，可以担保承销。有了这个例子以后，我们发现这个东西可以做，因为你可以赚好多钱。
<br><br>
到了1864年的时候，美国发生了南北战争，又需要钱，这时候他就发国债，想发20年、30年的国债，上一次因为借钱的费用非常高，这次就想怎么办？当时有一个新技术的产品，叫电报。在这个时候，还有一个小的投行，一个叫库克的人说我帮你承销，我不会收很高额的承销费，我用电报的方式帮你做承销。首先他把各个地方小的代理机构做登记，通过打电报的方式，在华盛顿向全国打电报去卖，这是由于新技术带来的一个销售渠道的革命。这个金融产品就发生了变化，这个非常成功，卖掉了10个亿美金的国债，而且是以平价的水平卖掉的，100块钱的面值可以卖100块钱。这就是由于科技的进步带来的金融产品的改变，他只收了千分之一的承销费。
<br><br>
到了今天的美国国债，已经完全不需要投行了，美联储就可以做了，通过网络就可以去做了。为什么不需要投行？渠道非常好，美国的国债不定性已经很小了，因为美国政府是最有信誉的政府，它的产品没有不定性，这时候渠道就够了，不用承销机构去承销了。可以看到科技的进步和信息的透明给你带来的金融产品的革命。<br><br>

案例三：大数据下的征信体系<br><br>

第三个例子，消费者信贷。上个世纪初分期付款的方式慢慢开始推行，我们现在用信用卡已经很习惯了，其实信用卡就是一个小贷，而且没有抵押品，其实是很难做的。<br><br>

在信用卡市场产生以前是没有不需要抵押的小贷，人们一直做的是典当。不需要抵押品，给你小贷是很难做的，消费者信贷是怎么做起来的？在一我开头的时候，慢慢有了分期付款。提供各种小贷，没有抵押品，我怎么知道你的品质呢？所以，我需要一个征信的服务，我们需要大数据，没有大数据征信是做不了的。包括二战以后，美国有一大批的军人退役，他对金融有需求，如果没有征信的评级就没有办法给你服务，在1956年的时候，美国第一家个人信用评分的公司产生了，到现在还是比较权威的评级机构。
<br><br>
有了征信基础之上，到1958年，什么样的记录都可以进来，这就是大数据的收集。到了1958年，第一个信用卡就产生了。信用卡产生了以后，推的很慢，因为它的成本很高，我们没有足够的大数据把征信做的足够好，一直到60年代有了计算机，这时候我们的运营成本才大幅度降低，这也是由于科技的进步带来了征信的发展，带来了消费者信贷，带来了信用卡的普及。这就是科技和金融的关系。由于科技的进步带来金融的创新。在这样一个背景下，Visa等信用卡的联盟就成立了。
<br><br>
这是美国的一些信用卡的利率，从96年到现在大概百分之十几，一般的违约率只有3%左右，信用卡这个东西还是挺赚钱的，而且信用卡往往是大的银行在做，越大数据的基础越充分，运营成本越低，其实是一种不用抵押的小贷，它产生的基础是征信和信息，对征信和信息的处理，一定是以科技发展为基础的。这就是科技给我们金融产品带来的创新的改变。
<br><br>
讲一个中国的案例，淘宝在08年的时候只有1000亿的规模，到2012年就到了一万亿，他们赶上了一个好的时代。08年以后，中国东部加工制造业产生过剩，而在西部，在三四线城市，有庞大的内需的人群，一方面是有需求，一方面是有生产，我们通过互联网把他们接起来，一下子淘宝几年翻了十倍。这就是架构了一个在互联网上国内的统一的大市场，通过互联网的力量，把中国的生产能力和内需接起来了，这是互联网公司给中国做的贡献。<br><br>

如果你要把网上的交易做好，一定要有评分，我们可以看得到这个产品，要给足够的评分，做的好就可以做起来了。同样的逻辑，当你把这些都做起来之后，你就搜集了很多信息，我们可以给商家去做评分，有了评分就可以做消费者信贷，可以做小贷，金融产品就产生了。这就是大数据所带来的金融的创新。<br><br>

 

互联网金融能做多大，需要技术革命的想象力
<br><br>
根据上述提到的，金融史的各种产品也告诉我们，第一，商业发展本来就会对金融产生需求。同时，技术进步会带来金融创新，这个创新又会带来新的金融需求。什么意思呢？在信用卡这样的金融产品产生以前，你是无法想象消费者信贷的。
<br><br>
将来互联网金融能做到多大，其实是没有足够的想象力的，为什么呢？因为这个产品没有产生，这个产品的产生依赖于大数据，我们有了新的科技会带来新的金融创新，它的体量可以是非常大的，现在可能没有足够的想象力。不止是现有的金融产品的转型，可能会产生更多的对金融的需求。<br><br>

技术革命有两个好处：渠道，把生产和需求联系起来了。由于大家做事情，就有了信息，有了信息就可以有征信，有了征信就可以有金融。
<br><br>
基于此，可以看到金融产品的六大机会：
<br><br>
第一，理财产品。到2013年的时候，美国大概有60多万亿美金的理财产品，家庭的财富金融资产只有15%的钱存在银行里，剩下的37%是在债券和股票里，48%是其它资产。中国大部分的钱还是放在银行里面，做理财还是比较小的。中国现在家庭的存款余额大概有49万亿，假设这个钱不只是放在银行里，至少有一半转化成理财产品，至少有20多万亿。还有非金融机构，存款大概有40万亿，假设有20%的钱给互联网，可以转成互联网理财的东西，大概有8万亿左右，加起来有三四十万亿的空间。所以说，理财将来是一个非常大的方向。所以，如果互联网公司有一个很大的渠道和平台，是很有可能做一个很大的网上理财的。
<br><br>
第二，消费者信贷。到今年6月份，中国人均持有信用卡只有0.3张，美国在2011年的时候就有1.8万亿持有信用卡，每个人持有7张卡，卡值8000美金。如果每个人持两张信用卡，卡值1000美金，大概会带来16万人民币的需求，比现在的3万亿翻五六倍，这又是非常大的消费者信贷的空间。<br><br>

第三，小贷。在中国，一般的小微企业，贡献中国GDP占60%左右，如果按照2013年的数字，贡献了大概30多万亿的GDP。中国是一个倾斜的金融体系，中国的钱70%以上的贷款是向国企、央企倾斜的。所以，一般中小企业、个体户是拿不到多少钱的，这块市场是很大的，如果我们有足够的征信的基础，能够给他们带来金融的服务，这块可能还有十几、二十万亿的小贷的规模，它是在科技进步的时代是有可能产生的。<br><br>

第四，保险。2013年中国的保险为1.7万亿，互联网保险是非常小的。1.7万亿的保险只有很少在互联网上。中国的保险渗透率是非常低的，中国人买保险的额度是很低的，我们为什么不买保险？因为我们不知道应该买什么样的保险，什么样的东西是好的。所以，这个市场也是非常大的。如果这块互联网化的话，也有几万亿的空间。
<br><br>
第五，供应链金融。互联网时代不是简单的B2C，现在是C2B的，从消费者引导零售、分销、品牌、生产。这个时代上面和下面，一个是物流，一个是金融。如果把这个供应链搭起来，信息打通，那么多的信息就可以提供供应链金融，因为我有了大量的信息，我就知道给你提供什么样的金融服务，这又是非常大的一块。
<br><br>
第六，网络银行。腾讯的微众银行已经下来了，阿里前几天网商银行也下来了。荷兰ING Direct网络银行，随着规模扩大，成本是降低的。成本占的客户存款的比率是非常低的，相对于传统银行来说，它的成本比较低，因为它不需要开非常多的店。但是中国的网络银行，除了渠道的优势，还有个非常重要的是什么呢？本来就有一个非常大的商业的场景，无论是腾讯的社交群体，还是阿里的网上的场景，有了这个场景，除了渠道，还有很多非常精准的信息。 如果做的好，中国的网络银行，尤其是已经有平台的互联网公司，借助平台做的网络银行，也可能有非常大的前景，跟从头去做网络银行是完全不一样的，因为它已经有了非常大的客户的基础支持它，有很多的信息，还有渠道的优势。<br><br>

互联网金融的黄金时代
<br><br>
最后提两个：第一，平台优势。互联网金融尤其有未来的，是那些有平台优势的公司。金融很重要的本质是它有不定性，谁能够把不定性降的很低。有了征信之后，就可以提供更好的金融产品，这个市场是非常大，不是没有人愿意投资，而是你不敢去投资。有平台优势的公司，最大的优势是大数据和征信。像阿里、腾讯，可以以这个平台做一个底层，做征信，这是互联网公司的优势，以这个为底层，可以跟社会上所有的金融机构，跟消费者结合起来，做非常不一样的普惠金融。这是平台公司最大的未来。中国是个资源倾斜的时代，一下子不会改变的，如果把钱撤出来，那些就会出问题。由于高科技革命带来的普惠金融的未来，就会有非常大的前景。
<br><br>
因为金融机构本身是有道德风险的，做金融机构是需要被监管的。在金融生态圈里，有监管者、有金融机构、有金融消费者。金融消费者，包括了投资人、中小企业、大企业等。如果互联网金融能够得到很好的发展，除了要做金融的创新，还需要监管者跟金融机构之间互动，尤其需要监管者知道这是一个大的历史机遇。阿里已经上市了，中国的BAT不知不觉之中已经做到了世界前几名的互联网公司。由于中国传统的服务不发达，互联网不发达，互联网金融可以走的更远，我们的金融监管者应该懂得这样的机遇，监管者和金融机构一起结合才能创造普惠金融的未来。<br><br>

从宏观的角度来说，中国的经济增长，一定是需要金融体系的发展去支持的，没有一个发达的国家是没有一个发达的金融体系的。但是，中国的金融体系是一个落后的、资源倾斜的，而且不会很快的改变，否则中国的国企、央企就要出问题了。所以，在这样一个背景之下，新的技术革命所带来的给金融消费者的服务就有非常大的前途。科技的革命，渠道的革命和信息的革命，还有新的金融创新的产品，由于渠道和信息带来了征信，这就是普惠金融的时代。
<br><br>
所以，如果你要做不一样的金融，这就是一个黄金的时代，这是我对这个愿景的理解。

马云IPO后首次公开讲话：融资250亿美金将投向哪儿？
<br><br>
钛媒体  2014-10-17 <br><br>
近日,马云现身阿里巴巴滨江园区,参加“中供十年陈回家”活动并发表讲话,这也是马云自上市后首次在员工面前公开讲话。马云的讲话充分展现了他的野心，也绘制出了阿里的蓝图。<br><br>

 

1、打造一个真正了不起的生态系统<br><br>

关于资金投向，马云说，“未来十年阿里要打造一个真正了不起的生态系统”。马云表示，这个生态系统目前只完成了20%，未来还有10年要做。<br><br>

为什么要打造这个生态系统？马云表示，打造这个生态系统的目的是帮助小企业。小企业需要消费者，需要最方便的金融，需要非常便宜的物流体系，也需要最便宜、最可靠的技术体系。同时，成千上万的小企业，需求又完全不一样。所以，只有建立一个生态系统，才能满足成千上万的小企业的需求。<br><br>

在这个生态系统里面，能够最快拿到定单，能够有最好的金融解决方案，能够有最便宜的物流解决方案，能够找到自己的消费者、自己的买家、自己的卖家。<br><br>

 

2、全球化<br><br>

谈到阿里巴巴未来的发展道路，马云透露自己最近思考的是全球化。马云说：“未来全球化、跨境贸易将成为我们主要发展的方向。未来两三年内，我们希望能够帮助菲律宾、帮助阿根廷、帮助韩国、帮助意大利、帮助全世界各地的小企业，让他们也能够像今天的淘宝一样，在这么一个平台上面，向全世界推销自己的商品、销售自己的商品。我们希望能为一千万小企业提供一个生存的平台，创造一亿的就业机会，还希望为全世界二十亿人提供消费，这是未来十年我们希望能够做到的。”
<br><br>
马云还表示，全球化除了淘宝、天猫、Aliexpress、阿里巴巴B2B的发展以外，还会大力推进全球化支付体系发展。
<br><br>
 

3、改变农村<br><br>

讲话中，马云恳请同事加入到改变整个农村的道路上去。马云表示，“现在很多农村，劳动力都到城里打工去了，留下的都是老人、孩子，我们想让这些孩子和你们的孩子一样，也可以用上电子产品，用上我们的云OS来接受教育。”
<br><br>
马云希望，让互联网、我们对互联网的认识等城市文明普照到任何一个小山村。“没有一件事情比这个更有意义，因为我们将改变的是千千万万人”，马云表示。（马云演讲资料来自财经网）

“一声芝麻开门，沉重的石洞门缓缓开启，里面珍宝熠熠生辉。这虽是天方夜谭里的事，但一位中国企业家正将之变成现实。”
<br><br>
马云第一次听说互联网是在1994年年底，那时候的马云还在杭州电子工业学院教书，除此之外还做外办主任。对于宁静的校园生活，马云就是觉得弊得慌。1994年整整一年，马云都在想如何离开学校，他觉得自己已经30岁了，再不干点什么的话一辈就这么过去了。90年代中期下海经商早已经不是什么新名词了，马云也想去做一家公司。他当时的心态，是不管做什么公司，只要有一个行业他就一定要跳下去。
<br><br>
马云有一个外籍教师叫比尔，美国西雅图人，比尔回了趟美国后，给马云讲起了互联网。马云觉得这是一个新东西，他听得比说的人还激动，但没什么行动。<br><br>

到了1995年，马云才真跳离了校园，但不是办企业，更不是做互联网，而是跑去美国帮别人收账了。也就是那次收账，马云碰上了美国黑社会、遇上了杀手，也爱上了互联网。	<br><br>
中国黄页	<br><br>
在美国，马云去拉斯维加斯赌了一把，手气不错，用25美分就在老虎机上赢了六百美金，这六百美金成为马云走上互联网道路的第一笔天使资金，后来跟随马云走南闯北好几年的电脑就是花这600美金买的。	<br><br>
马云现在最喜欢的城市第一是杭州，第二是西雅图。杭州是马云出生、求学、立业的地方，而在西雅图，马云爱上了互联网。	<br><br>
马云在西雅图的第一次Internet亲密接触，是在一家做ISP的公司，叫什么已经想不起来了，只记得很简陋，两间小得不能再小的办公室里，猫着5个对着屏幕不停敲键盘的年轻人。当时马云连电脑都不敢碰，要等别人说“不要紧，你就用吧！”。	<br><br>
马云在键盘上敲了“beer”，呼的一下，屏幕上弹出了德国啤酒、美国啤酒、日本啤酒……，一排排的Beer，但就是没有中国啤酒，接着马云又试了“Chinese”，但是Yahoo竟然出来个“NoData”，再查整个Internet上还真是没有相关“Chinese”的Data。	<br><br>
中国是占世界上人口四分之一的大国，一跺脚地球抖三抖的大国啊，在互联网上竟然没有Chinese！这让马云很惊奇，也很难受，就在那一刻，不懂网络的马云决定在中国建一个互联网公司，于是他就跟那家美国公司讲：我们合作，你在美国负责技术，我回国内去做。	<br><br>
马云一回国就请了朋友到家里聚会，都是平时玩的最好的，一共24人，马云宣布了两件事：辞职、做网站。马云讲了2个小时，大家都没有听清楚，马云自己也不清楚都讲了什么东西。讲完之后24个人当中有23个人说互联网太先进了，劝马云别往里面扎，万一出不来怎么办？你开酒吧、开饭店、就是办个夜校都一定行，但就是不要干这个什么“英特耐特”。	<br><br>
马云不顾绝大多数人意见创办的网站就是“中国黄页”。“中国黄页”前期的投入，是马云自己拿出了六、七千，又从妹夫、妹妹那儿借来一些，东拼西凑了2万，然后再将家具差不多都卖光了，攒齐了必须的10万本钱。然后马云、马云的太太、马云大学同学何一兵三个人，只租一间房间当办公室，只用了一台电脑（马云从美国带回来的那台486），靠一块钱一块钱数着花付完房租后剩下的5000元，创办了中国黄页，在1995年5月挂上了真正的Internet,刷新了中国互联网史上第一个B2B的网页。	<br><br>
马云事后形容自己的创举，用的是“盲人骑瞎虎”，是一点儿都不知道Internet是要吃人、吃钱的！	<br><br>
中国黄页的主要业务是给企业做网站，具体的做法是先艰难地说服企业提交产品样本，然后由马云寄到美国，在美国做好Homepage后放到网上，并打印一份给国内的企业。当时全中国没几个知道互联网是什么东西，马云做得很凄苦，就跟骗子似的。不认识的人不好骗，马云便“兔子先吃窝边草”，拿朋友开场，靠多年来在朋友中的信用，朋友们虽觉得互联网这事儿挺玄，但冲着马云，就做了。	<br><br>
第一个客户是杭州一个四星级宾馆，马云的朋友何向阳，冲着马云这个人，冲着马云嘴皮上的功夫，把活儿给下来了。当时利润不高，大头都叫美国那边做网页的人拿去了，美国那边动动键盘要60%的分成，12000元，马云几个人累死累活白天黑夜沾客户才拿8000块。Cash教育得马云立刻就感觉到了核心技术对盈利的重要性，毫不迟疑招了一个会做网页的人自己做。	<br><br>
为了学习马云下载了一个美国的网页，他花了三个半小时，亲身体验了什么叫网速太慢，全中国就24K。	<br><br>
第一次失败	<br><br>
中国黄页在一夜之间冒出来了许多“敌人”，包括田溯宁的亚信、杭州电信这样的重量级对手。亚信差点成了中国黄页的死敌，幸好田溯宁觉得做这块不但与中国黄页比没有优势，就是与杭州电信比也说不清鹿死谁手，于是就退出来了。剩下的就是一家：杭州电信。这是一场实力悬殊的战争，杭州电信注册资本3亿多，马云注册资本仅2万；这也是一场你死我活的战争，杭州就这么大一个庙，容不下两个和尚。杭州电信有着非常好的社会资源和政府资源，马云一样都没有。不仅企业，就是老百姓，也觉得马云是非正规军、是游击队，最多也就一土八路，没人肯信他们。	<br><br>
杭州电信为了利用中国黄页(chinapage.com)已有的名声，做了一个名字很近的网站chinesepage.com，也叫“中国黄页”，分割马云们的“中国黄页”的市场。	<br><br>
马云为了活下去，马云与杭州电信牵手了，1996年3月份，中国黄页将资产折合成60万人民币，占30%的股份，杭州电信投入资金140万人民币，占70%的股份。	<br><br>
马云的中国黄页1995年亏了点，1996年年底，就有了700万人民币的营业额，到了1997年，网络也开始热起来了，马云当了两年先锋，互联网在中国终于有了一定的局面，但就在这时，马云与杭州电信的合作出了问题，合作方相互之间争来争去，大家开始情绪激动地处事，先是何一兵要辞职，然后中国黄页的全体员工要辞职，最后马云也要辞职了，动静大到了《人民日报》的记者来过问这事儿。为了中国黄页的前途，各方面都想马云回去，但马云心里委屈，觉得自己真不容易，打南打北打到头没自己的地儿了！执意要走。	<br><br>
马云走是走了，心里还一直留着“中国黄页”这个自己一手养大的孩子，就在离去之即，马云还在与人讨论“中国黄页”下一步如何走；就是面对着哭着闹着要跟马云一起走的属下，也还是硬起心肠说：不行，你们走了中国黄页怎么办？自己拥有的21%中国黄页的股份，马云也都全部送给了一起创业的员工，只为让他们能为自己好好耕耘，好好收获。	<br><br>
北漂	<br><br>
马云去北京是件很偶然的事。“中国黄页”曾跟浙江省合作，搞了个“金格工程”，出来之后引起了很大的哄动，连美国参议院都发来了贺电，祝贺中国政府上网。马云当时正愁无名，想借这事儿给炒一下，1995年12月份马云到北京，将一些文章也带到北京，请朋友找找关系看能不能帮着发表。	<br><br>
1995年初还没有媒体敢大张旗鼓地谈互联网，除非头儿是一个特有魄力的人。马云有个朋友认识《北京青年报》的一个司机，就给了他500元钱，只要有媒体发表，那么钱就是他的。这人也真有办法，不久《中国贸易报》头版出了其中的一篇文章。这事儿完了之后马云认识了他们的头，两人相约一起谈谈。开始马云没敢提互联网，怕别人不懂导致冷场，没想到一谈就是两天两夜，越谈越投机，对方拍着胸口说：我支持你，过一段时间我搞一个活动，请一些编辑、记者朋友过来，你们见见面。	<br><br>
那时候各种报纸都在报道的是当时最红的牟其中，马云是个小角色，要想在媒体上露一次脸得费很多周折。1个月后马云出了3万元钱，在北京外经贸部隔壁的“长安”俱乐部搞了个聚会，请了30多位记者、编辑。一大清早马云就开始安装两台从杭州带过来的台式电脑，网速太慢，没办法联网，马云就将内容拷到硬盘上。马云讲了两个小时，觉得自己讲得很精彩，也讲得很累。	<br><br>
记者、编辑们来了又走了，北京没人把他们当回事儿，曲终人散之后的马云孤独极了。但就在那天马云对同伴说：总有一天我们要理直气壮地来到北京。其实马云的心情也很沮丧，只是不想说。	<br><br>
当时的一些工程院院士不看好网络的前景，说网络太先进了，不适合中国的国情，信息高速公路离中国太远。在马云看来，这纯粹是无稽之谈、荒谬透顶。马云有次在《人民日报》讲课的时候很紧张、很激动的说：对于发展中国家来说，中国搭上的是末班车，错过了就很难再有一次机会了，对处于劣势的我们来说进攻是最好的防守……	<br><br>
听完马云讲完课之后，时任《人民日报》秘书长的范敬宜觉得政府上网是一种必须，第二天就打报告给中央，申请让《人民日报》上网，没多长时间就给批下来了。直到这时，马云在北京才摆脱了失业者的身份：做《人民日报》的上网工程，这是一件大事，中央电视台、东方时空都做了报道。	<br><br>
但北漂的日子并不惬意，马云干得倒是很多，几乎所有的媒体都做完了，但就是没有赚到1分钱。《人民日报》对他蛮不错，把从北京到杭州之间来来去去的车票给付了，其他单位简直是亏着做。为了省钱，晚上睡朋友的办公室，早上吃麦当劳，晚上吃麦当劳，这种日子马云过了一年，结果留下了后遗症：一见到麦当劳就恶心，就想吐！	<br><br>
再见EDI中心	<br><br>
马云离开中国黄页，外经贸部对马云说：到北京来吧，来这儿你能干得更好！就这样，马云带了5个年轻人又到了北京。马云在北京租了一个不到20平方米的小房间，没日没夜的干活，给外经贸部做站点，让外经贸部成为了中国第一个上网的部级单位。	<br><br>
马云当时做得不错，外经贸部另立一家公司：EDI（中国国际电子商务）中心，由马云组建、管理，马云占30%的股份、外经贸部占70%的股份，但实际上马云一个月就几千元的工资，其他什么也没有。	<br><br>
时间一长马云发现很多事在政府的编制里很难做，存在着许多说不清的问题。当时人们都说马云与外经贸部的合作是中国的“梦之队”，但事实上是怎么一回事谁也不清楚。	<br><br>
怎么办？马云天天思量。	<br><br>
留在北京吗？机会倒是有，比如新浪和雅虎都希望马云去加盟，但马云发现北京的网络太浮躁，在这里面很难做成一件事；还在企业里面吗？马云已经受够了；马云还觉得中国的网络形式已经在开始发生变化，全世界互联网高潮马上就要到来，留在政府里对不起这千载难逢的良机。想来想去，马云觉得还是南下。	<br><br>
1997年，就在丁磊带着网易北上的那天，马云却着自己的队伍南下回了杭州。	<br><br>
离开北京	<br><br>
下决心了，离开互联网狂欢的中心回杭州，马云和同伴们都有点失落。	<br><br>
那天晚上他们相约在一起吃饭、喝酒，不知过了多久，反正大家都醉得差不多了。也不知是谁带的头，大家一起唱“真心英雄”，唱完“真心英雄”就唱老歌，一首接一首，但这群走南闯北的汉子们都回避着“离别”这个对他们来说太过沉重的词语……	<br><br>
第二天说好逛长城，来北京都一年了，大家总是在工作中渡过，从没有痛痛快快地玩一场，长城除了马云陪杨致远去过一次之外，大家都没有去过。走在长城上面，大家的心情特别沉重，没有人能想通自己做了那么多，为公司赢利那么多却一分钱都没有赚到，连在北京立足之地都没有？记不清是谁，他们中的一个人突然号啕大哭，对着长城大声喊：为什么，为什么？	<br><br>
马云对于自己将要做什么也不清楚，但他知道自己一定不会再在政府里面做官僚了。马云对一直跟着他的那8个人说：我要回去了，你们可以留在北京，有谁要是想去雅虎、新浪的话，我可以向杨致远、王志东、茅道林他们推荐；也可以跟我回去，如果跟我回去的话，那么就在我们家上班，就170个平米的地儿，工资500元钱一月，10个月一个假期，住的房子必须离我们家很近……	<br><br>
这些人都是中国网络界的第一代高手，如果留在北京的话，一个月拿个上万是轻飘飘的事儿，就待遇来说，杭州与北京相比简直就是一个地狱，一个天堂。	<br><br>
但是不到5分钟，8个人全部对马云说：我们跟你回杭州！	<br><br>
亚洲电子商务大会	<br><br>
马云对长城印象最深的，是到处刻着“张三到此一游”、“李四到此一游”的“贴子”，马云觉得这就是中国最早的“贴子”，是中国最早的BBS。马云决定就从BBS做起。	<br><br>
1999年新加坡政府在亚洲组织了一个“亚洲电子商务大会”，会议组织者邀请马云作为中国唯一的参与者。马云没有接触过电子商务，当时挺奇怪为什么请自己而不请一个老板。组织者说：我们的调查机构在中国做过调查，觉得你最适合讲中国的电子商务。	<br><br>
当时与会的演讲者有80%是美国人，参加者有80%也是美国人，100%讲的是亚马逊、EBAY、AOL，雅虎……，轮到马云，他站起来就说：美国是美国，亚洲是亚洲，我们不能照般亚马逊、EBAY、AOL，雅虎的模式，亚洲80%的企业是中小型企业，亚洲一定得有自己的模式……	<br><br>
就在讲电子商务的时候，马云想好了未来公司的关键：第一，公司的名称要包含东方的智慧、西方的故事，就叫“阿里巴巴”；第二，东方的智慧有一种小家子气，必须起用有欧美留学背景的人才以弥补这种缺憾。	<br><br>
阿里巴巴	<br><br>
马云回到杭州，就用电话给全国的朋友、部属讲自己在新加坡成熟的想法，鼓动，“下礼拜的今天你们就过来吧！”	<br><br>
1999年2月21号，马云对另外17条好汉说：“现在每个人留下一点饭钱，其余的放下”，结果放下了6万美金，站起了阿里巴巴最初的团队。	<br><br>
在阿里巴巴与汇亚的投资谈判过程中，蔡崇信走进了马云的视野。蔡崇信在耶鲁大学毕业之后在纽约当了两年律师，然后又被派到一个投资公司当副总裁。他听说阿里巴巴，觉得挺有意思，就飞到杭州来拜访马云。同马云谈了两天，蔡崇信觉得阿里巴巴是一个很难得的模式，马云觉得蔡崇信是一个做事的人。谈完汇亚的投资之后，蔡崇信领着马云去了硅谷，当时互联网正好是最热的时候，很多人都要投资阿里巴巴，蔡崇信帮着马云又搞定了沃尔顿。	<br><br>
回到杭州之后马云与蔡崇信又在一起呆了4天4夜，蔡崇信说：我决定加盟阿里巴巴，希望你能考虑。马云说：没问题，你来，就管钱吧。	<br><br>
蔡崇信一管钱，就管来了亚洲的汇亚、欧洲的InvestorAB、美国的高盛、新加坡的TTA等投资公司的投资。	<br><br>
继蔡崇信之后，雅狐引擎的发明人吴炯加入了；2000年1月份，现在的COO，关明生加盟，形成了阿里巴巴新的管理团队。	<br><br>
圈钱	<br><br>
很多网络公司都拿着一个商业策划书去圈钱，但马云不一样。阿里巴巴成立之后，马云决定：做出东西再说，没做出东西之前不与任何媒体接触。直到1999年6月份，马云与汇亚投资公司总裁在香港偶然相遇，两人一聊就聊了一个月，之后，对方就有投资的意思，说：我给你半个小时搞个讲座，董事会的人都来听，如果董事会说行就行，不行就拉到。马云就去讲了自己对互联网的理解、对企业的理解。讲完之后，马云还在犯蒙，对方的人说：我们原想投300万美元的，现在决定投500万美元！	<br><br>
这算是阿里巴巴口头圈的第一笔投资。	<br><br>
1999年10月30号，孙正义给马云写信，相约在北京见一面。地点是孙正义投资的UT斯达康的楼上，去的时候马云还以为就他和孙正义两个人聊聊，结果那儿简直是在“开市”，有好多人排队拿自己的商业策划书在孙正义面前争取投资。马云虽然并不是太想要钱，但既来之，而安之，也上去“大言不惭”地讲了一通。6分钟之后孙正义说：就你们这个公司能做成全世界一流的网站，能做成亚马逊，能打出世界的品牌，我决定投你们的网站！	<br><br>
孙正义的一投就要投3000万美元，但马云只要了2000万美元。	<br><br>
这是阿里巴巴的第二笔投资。	<br><br>
三大理想	<br><br>
第一、三年以内实现赢利；	<br><br>
第二、做80年企业；	<br><br>
第三、做世界10大网站。	<br><br>
创立阿里巴巴时，马云计划三大理想分三步走：1999年无中生有，建立阿里巴巴网站；2000年扩大知名度，抢占眼球，避开甲A直接进入世界杯，打入海外市场；2001年，收回中国市场。	<br><br>
马云花了三年时间做了一件“防弹衣”，制造了一个巨大的市场：让所有的卖家和买家都来访问阿里巴巴。因为只要把商家的资料往阿里巴巴上一放，那么凭阿里巴巴的名声带去的客户、带去的访问量，其他网站想都不能想。就像在北京最热闹的街道上搞一个摊点，所有的商家都会过来。随着这个市场越来越大，阿里巴巴的摊点也越来越贵：从1.8万元收起、到2万、再到3万，到从2002年1月18号起就要4万元。	<br><br>
马云说不清自己的模式，也讲不出一个动听故事，他只是反复强调“务实”这两个字。马云认同的商业模式只有一种：收入减去成本等于利润。	<br><br>
2001年12月28日马云以宣布阿里巴巴赢利的方式，兑现了阿里巴巴的第一个理想。	<br><br>
西湖论剑	<br><br>
让中国互联网浪漫的是马云这个老牌“金庸迷”折腾起来的“西湖论剑”。	<br><br>
2000年的7月29日，金庸迷马云与偶像金庸相约香港“庸记酒家”。那天马云特别激动，那天，金庸为马云手书“神交以久，一见如故”，俩人成了一对忘年交。	<br><br>
2000年，互联网是个宠儿，IT界特别热闹，也特别累。马云有次到龙井山上喝茶时就想趁着生日请几个朋友到西湖边轻松一下，还梦想请金庸来坐论，给大家的书上签名。	<br><br>
没想到金庸接到电话后很痛快地答应了。这下马云来劲了，又给王峻涛打电话，然后是丁磊、张朝阳，都没什么问题，难找的是王志东，马云说他到处在窜，马云打电话老是碰不着，所以王志东是最后一个找到的。到了最后几天，王志东突然告诉马云说有事儿不能来了。马云急了：哥们儿不是坑人吗？立马赶到北京找到王志东谈了两个小时，王志东才来。	<br><br>
马云觉得能让中国风络江湖化、浪漫化是一件功德无量的事儿，2000年的“西湖论剑”的话题大家就是谈武侠、网络与江湖，真可以说是“把酒论英雄”。马云觉得大家都是英雄，但不是睥睨天下的英雄，在这个草莽时代，大家只能做草莽英雄。	<br><br>
武侠江湖是一个“大碗喝酒、大块吃肉、快意恩仇”的地方，但网络江湖却是一个化解恩怨的地方：2000年的“西湖论剑”让丁磊和张朝阳结下了很好的友谊；2001年的“西湖论剑”让张朝阳和茅道林合好如初，两“仇人”单独谈了45分钟之后成了哥们。2001年王志东没来，马云心存遗憾，给王志东打电话的时候王志东说等新公司理顺了再来，马云希望2002年能见到王志东，一起喝茶论道。（文章来自作者10年前在《知识经济》供职的文章――《马云巴巴》）	<br><br>
采编手记：	<br><br>
马云最喜欢的城市是杭州。高中毕业时马云想过离开杭州，考到北大去上学，但没想到考了三年才考上杭州师范学校。为这事，马云至今还耿耿于怀，说自己不够聪明。尽管很多自以聪明的人都没有干成马云一样的事业。	<br><br>
马云教师当得不错，马云29岁时，就被评为杭州10大杰出青年教师，在杭州英语也教得很有名气，能常接一些翻译的活，与一般人相比，还算年青有为。	<br><br>
那时候的马云是名人也是能人，很多人找他作翻译，可是他自己又没时间，于是他就找他的老师来做，刚好他们退了休没什么事儿做，做翻译刚好能赚点儿外快。1992年马云开了一家翻译社，第一个月的全部收入700元，但房租就得2400元，扣除了房租还得倒贴1700元。头三年马云不但没有赚钱还赔钱，为让翻译社生存下去，马云就利用翻译社的门面卖点儿鲜花、礼品什么的。	<br><br>
贩卖知识加鲜花马云贩腻了，也觉得没多大劲，不想再在学校里玩下去了，就有了中国黄页、阿里巴巴。	<br><br>
马云做出决定离开学校的那天晚上，浙江广播电台请他去做客，很多人问马云什么时候再回到学校？马云一诺是10年。	<br><br>
十年之期已过七，人在江湖的马云知道杨过守住了小龙女的“十六年之约”，是因为那是金庸写的故事，而Internet上的故事……	<br><br>

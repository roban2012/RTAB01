Such amounts are borrowed at floating interest rates which range from LIBOR plus 3.0% to 4.5% per annum.

As of March 31, 2013, such amounts are collateralized by certain equity interests in the Company’s major subsidiaries and the Company maintained a debt service reserve account collateralized in favor of the lenders in connection with these facilities (Note 11). The facilities were primarily used to finance the privatization of Alibaba.com Limited (Note 4(b)) and the Initial Repurchase (Note 4(a)) during the year ended March 31, 2013. During the nine months ended December 31, 2013, the Company repaid the entire US$4.0 billion syndicated loans.  <br><br>

Such amount is borrowed at floating interest rates of LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum.

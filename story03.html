Our Major Corporate Milestones <br><br>

We have a demonstrated track record of successful organic business creation and growth, as evidenced by the following description of our major corporate milestones: <br><br>

<a href= "pic26.html">History milestones</a><br><br>

Our 18 founders first gathered in Jack Ma’s apartment in Hangzhou in 1999 and founded Alibaba.com. Our founders and management would go on to launch a number of our core businesses from that apartment, including Alibaba.com.cn (now known as 1688.com), Taobao Marketplace and Alimama, meeting in the same spirit of partnership and with the same goal: to make it easy to do business anywhere. <br><br>

We began operations in 1999 with Alibaba.com, an English-language marketplace for global trade. We founded Alibaba.com to help small exporters engaged in manufacturing and trading, primarily located in China, to reach global buyers. In 1999, we also launched a Chinese-language wholesale marketplace for domestic China trade among small businesses, now called 1688.com. This domestic platform has since evolved into a wholesale channel for merchants doing business on our retail marketplaces to source products. <br><br>

In 2003, we established Taobao Marketplace as a free platform for buyers to explore and discover products and for sellers to establish a low-cost online presence. According to iResearch, Taobao Marketplace was the number one consumer-to-consumer, or C2C, marketplace in terms of gross merchandise volume in China in 2013. 
<br><br>
In 2004, we established Alipay to address the issue of trust between buyers and sellers online. Buyers were unwilling to effect payment before receiving and inspecting their purchases, and sellers were unwilling to ship the products until they were assured that payment was forthcoming. This lack of trust posed a stifling challenge for the development of online commerce in China. Alipay introduced its escrow service as a solution to this problem. Since 2011, we no longer control or have an ownership interest in Alipay, although we continue to participate in some of the economic benefits of Alipay through contractual arrangements. We have entered into contractual arrangements with Alipay through which we are able to facilitate the provision of payment and escrow services for our customers. See “Related Party Transactions ― Agreements and Transactions Related to Small and Micro Financial Services Company and its Subsidiaries.” In 2013, Alipay was the largest online third-party payment services provider in China by total payment volume, according to iResearch. 
<br><br>
In 2004, we also launched Aliwangwang, a personal computer-based instant messenger that facilitates text, audio and video communication between buyers and sellers, on Taobao Marketplace. 
<br><br>
In 2007, we launched Alimama, our online marketing technology platform that offers sellers on our marketplaces online marketing services for both personal computers and mobile devices. Alimama also offers our sellers these marketing services through third-parties through the Taobao Affiliate Network, which we believe is the largest online marketing affiliate network in China in terms of revenue shared with our affiliates. In 2007, we also started to monetize our Taobao Marketplace through P4P marketing services and display marketing. 
<br><br>
In 2008, we launched Tmall as we recognized that Chinese consumers had developed an increased demand for branded products and a premium online shopping experience. 
<br><br>
In 2009, we established Alibaba Cloud Computing to handle the traffic volume generated and data management needs resulting from the substantial scale of transactions and data on our platform. Today, Alibaba Cloud Computing addresses the data management needs of our company and our related companies, including Alipay, and at the same time generates third party revenue from sellers doing business on our marketplaces as well as other businesses and entrepreneurs who have cloud computing needs, and gives our sellers the computing power and scalability to handle spikes in transaction volume such as during our Singles Day promotion. 
<br><br>
In 2010, we launched AliExpress, our global consumer marketplace that enables exporters in China to reach and directly transact with consumers around the world. Also in 2010, we launched Juhuasuan, our group buying marketplace that offers quality products at discounted prices by aggregating demand from consumer groups, mainly through flash sales which make products available for a limited period of time. In 2010, we also launched our Mobile Taobao App, which has been the most popular mobile commerce app in China by MAUs every month since August 2012, according to iResearch. 
<br><br>


On November 11, 2013, our Singles Day promotion generated GMV settled through Alipay of RMB36.2 billion (US$5.8 billion) on our China retail marketplaces within a 24-hour period. 
<br><br>
Our History with SoftBank and Yahoo 
<br><br>
In 2000, a group of investors led by SoftBank invested US$20 million in our company. In 2003, we established a joint venture with SoftBank for the development of the predecessor entity of Taobao Marketplace. Through a series of investments totaling US$50 million, SoftBank subscribed for shares in the Taobao predecessor entity. In 2003, SoftBank purchased US$30 million in our convertible notes, which SoftBank subsequently converted into our ordinary shares. 
<br><br>
In 2005, Yahoo completed a strategic investment in our company which resulted in Yahoo owning approximately 40% in our company on a fully-diluted basis at that time. In connection with the consummation of the strategic investment, Yahoo invested a total of US$1,000 million in cash and contributed Yahoo China to Alibaba Group. Specifically, Yahoo purchased US$570 million in ordinary shares from certain shareholders and US$70 million in newly issued ordinary shares from us. In conjunction with the strategic investment, Yahoo also purchased a portion of SoftBank’s shares in the Taobao predecessor entity for an aggregate amount of US$360 million, which Yahoo subsequently exchanged for our ordinary shares. In connection with these transactions, SoftBank exchanged its remaining stake in the Taobao predecessor entity for our ordinary shares and reinvested US$180 million in convertible bonds in our company which were subsequently converted into our ordinary shares. 
<br><br>
In 2012, we entered into a share repurchase agreement with Yahoo pursuant to which we repurchased 523 million of our shares from Yahoo for US$7,082 million, and we restructured the Yahoo TIPLA for a lump sum payment to Yahoo of US$550 million. In the same transaction, we entered into an agreement that requires Yahoo, in connection with a qualified initial public offering of our shares (such as this offering), at our election, to either sell to us or include in such qualified initial public offering, an additional 261.5 million of our ordinary shares, which we later amended to 208 million shares.

	<b><a name="T3">Contractual Arrangements </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	


Contractual Arrangements among Our Wholly-foreign Owned Enterprises, Variable Interest Entities and the Variable Interest Entity Equity Holders 	<br><br>
Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-added telecommunications services, which include the operations of Internet content providers, or ICPs, we, similar to all other entities with foreign-incorporated holding company structures operating in our industry in China, operate our Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited in the PRC through wholly-foreign owned enterprises, majority-owned entities and variable interest entities. The relevant variable interest entities, which are 100% owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned by PRC citizens, where applicable, hold the ICP licenses and other regulated licences and operate our Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited. Specifically, our variable interest entities are generally majority-owned by Jack Ma, our lead founder, executive chairman and one of our principal shareholders, and minority-owned by Simon Xie, one of our founders and a member of our management. We have entered into certain contractual arrangements, as described in more detail below, which collectively enable us to exercise effective control over the variable interest entities and realize substantially all of the economic risks and benefits arising from, the variable interest entities. As a result, we include the financial results of each of the variable interest entities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP as if they were our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 	<br><br>
Other than the ICP licenses and other licenses and approvals for businesses in which foreign ownership is restricted or prohibited held by our variable interest entities, we hold our material assets in, and conduct our material operations through, our wholly-foreign owned and majority-owned enterprises, which primarily provide technology and other services to our customers. We generate the significant majority of our revenue directly through our wholly-foreign owned enterprises, which directly capture the profits and associated cash flow from operations without having to rely on contractual arrangements to transfer such cash flow from the variable interest entities to the wholly-foreign owned enterprises. 	<br><br>
The following diagram is a simplified illustration of the ownership structure and contractual arrangements that we typically have in place for our variable interest entities: 	<br><br>
<a href= "pic27.html">ownership structure and contractual arrangements</a><br><br>	<br><br>
The following is a summary of the common contractual arrangements that provide us with effective control of our material variable interest entities and that enable us to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from their operations. 	<br><br>
Contracts that give us effective control of the variable interest entities 	<br><br>
Loan Agreements. Pursuant to the relevant loan agreement, the respective wholly-foreign owned enterprise has granted an interest-free loan to the relevant variable interest entity equity holders, which may only be used for the purpose of a capital contribution to the relevant variable interest entity or as may be otherwise agreed by the wholly-foreign owned enterprise. The wholly-foreign owned enterprise may require acceleration of repayment at its absolute discretion. When the variable interest entity equity holders make early repayment of the outstanding amount, the wholly-foreign owned enterprise or a third party designated by it may purchase the equity interests in the variable interest entity at a price equal to the outstanding amount of the loan, subject to any applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. The variable interest entity equity holders undertake not to enter into any prohibited transactions in relation to the variable interest entity, including the transfer of any business, material assets, intellectual property rights or equity interests in the variable interest entity to any third party. 	<br><br>
Exclusive Call Option Agreements. The variable interest entity equity holders have granted the wholly-foreign owned enterprise an exclusive call option to purchase their equity interest in the variable interest entity at an exercise price equal to the higher of (i) the registered capital in the variable interest entity; and (ii) the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC laws. Each relevant variable interest entity has further granted the relevant wholly-foreign owned enterprise an exclusive call option to purchase its assets at an exercise price equal to the book value of the assets or the minimum price as permitted by applicable PRC law, whichever is higher. The wholly-foreign owned enterprise may nominate another entity or individual to purchase the equity interest or assets, if applicable, under the call options. Each call option is exercisable subject to the condition that applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations do not prohibit completion of the transfer of the equity interest or assets pursuant to the call option. Each wholly-foreign owned enterprise is entitled to all dividends and other distributions declared by the variable interest entity, and the variable interest entity equity holders have agreed to give up their rights to receive any distributions or proceeds from the disposal of their equity interests in the variable interest entity which are in excess of the original registered capital that they contributed to the variable interest entity, and to pay any such distributions or premium to the wholly-foreign owned enterprise. The exclusive call option agreements remain in effect until the equity interest or assets that are the subject of such agreements are transferred to the wholly-foreign owned enterprise. 	<br><br>
Proxy Agreements. Pursuant to the relevant Proxy Agreement, each of the variable interest entity equity holders irrevocably authorizes any person designated by the wholly-foreign owned enterprise to exercise his rights as an equity holder of the variable interest entity, including the right to attend and vote at equity holders’ meetings and appoint directors. 	<br><br>
Equity Pledge Agreements. Pursuant to the relevant equity pledge agreement, the relevant variable interest entity equity holders have pledged all of their interests in the equity of the variable interest entity as a continuing first priority security interest in favor of the wholly-foreign owned enterprise to secure the outstanding amounts advanced under the relevant loan agreements described above and to secure the performance of obligations by the variable interest entity and/or its equity holders under the other structure contracts. Each wholly-foreign owned enterprise is entitled to exercise its right to dispose of the variable interest entity equity holders’ pledged interests in the equity of the variable interest entity and has priority in receiving payment by the application of proceeds from the auction or sale of such pledged interests, in the event of any breach or default under the loan agreement or other structure contracts, if applicable. These equity pledge agreements remain in force for the duration of the relevant loan agreement and other structure contracts. All of the equity pledges have been registered with the relevant office of the Administration for Industry and Commerce in China. 	<br><br>
Contracts that enable us to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from the variable interest entities 	<br><br>
Exclusive Technical Services Agreements. Each relevant variable interest entity has entered into an exclusive technical services agreement with the respective wholly-foreign owned enterprise, pursuant to which the relevant wholly-foreign owned enterprise provides exclusive technical services to the variable interest entity. In exchange, the variable interest entity pays a service fee to the wholly-foreign owned enterprise which typically amount to what would be substantially all of the variable interest entity’s pre-tax profit (absent the service fee), resulting in a transfer of substantially all of the profits from the variable interest entity to the wholly-foreign owned enterprise. 	<br><br>
The exclusive call option agreements described above also entitle the wholly-foreign owned enterprise to all dividends and other distributions declared by the variable interest entity and to any distributions or proceeds from the disposal by the variable interest entity equity holders of their equity interests in the variable interest entity that are in excess of the original registered capital that they contributed to the variable interest entity. 	<br><br>
In the opinion of Fangda Partners, our PRC legal counsel: 	<br><br>
--the ownership structures of our material wholly-foreign owned enterprises and our material variable interest entities in China, both currently and immediately after giving effect to this offering, do not and will not violate any applicable PRC law, regu	<br><br>
--the contractual arrangements between our material wholly-foreign owned enterprises, our material variable interest entities and the variable interest entity equity holders governed by PRC laws are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws, rules, and regulations currently in effect, and will not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect.	<br><br>
However, we have been further advised by our PRC legal counsel, Fangda Partners, that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities may in the future take a view that is contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. We have been further advised by our PRC legal counsel that if the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our Internet-based business do not comply with PRC government restrictions on foreign investment in the aforesaid business we engage in, we could be subject to severe penalties including being prohibited from continuing operations.

	<b><a name="T5">Non-GAAP Measures </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We use the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted net income (loss) and free cash flow in evaluating our operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. 
<br><br>
We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (loss) from operations and adjusted net income (loss) help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (loss) from operations and adjusted net income (loss). We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (loss) from operations and adjusted net income (loss) provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. 
<br><br>
We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet. We use free cash flow to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance and allocate resources. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a reporting period. 
<br><br>
Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted net income (loss) and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net income, cash flows or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted net income (loss) and free cash flow presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data. <br><br>

Adjusted EBITDA represents income (loss) from operations (which excludes interest and investment income (loss), net, interest expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity investees) before (i) certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as well as (ii) one-time expense items consisting of the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment and an equity-settled donation expense that we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the period presented. 
<br><br>
Adjusted income (loss) from operations represents income (loss) from operations (which excludes interest income and investment income (loss), net, interest expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity investees) before share-based compensation expense, one-time expense items consisting of the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment and an equity-settled donation expense that we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the period presented. <br><br>

Adjusted net income (loss) represents net income (loss) before share-based compensation expenses, one-time expense items consisting of the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment and an equity-settled donation expense. 
<br><br>
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights for, and construction of, our office campuses in China) and intangible assets, adjusted for changes in loan receivables relating to micro loans of our SME loan business and the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment. We present the adjustment for changes in loan receivables because such receivables are reflected under cash flow from operating activities, whereas the secured borrowings and other bank borrowings used to finance them are reflected under cash flows from financing activities, and accordingly, the adjustment is made to show cash flows from operating activities net of the effect of changes in loan receivables.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled “Summary Consolidated Financial and Operating Data” and “Selected Consolidated Financial and Operating Data” and our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and elsewhere in this prospectus. We have prepared our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our fiscal year ends on March 31 and references to fiscal year 2012 are to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 and references to fiscal year 2013 are to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. 
<br><br>
Overview 
<br><br>
We are the largest online and mobile commerce company in the world in terms of gross merchandise volume in 2013, according to industry sources. We operate our marketplaces as a platform for third parties, and we do not engage in direct sales, compete with our merchants or hold inventory. We operate Taobao Marketplace, China’s largest online shopping destination, Tmall, China’s largest third-party platform for brands and retailers, in each case in terms of gross merchandise volume, and Juhuasuan, China’s most popular group buying marketplace by its monthly active users, in each case in 2013 according to iResearch. These three marketplaces, which comprise our China retail marketplaces, generated a combined GMV of RMB1,542 billion (US$248 billion) from 231 million active buyers and 8 million active sellers in the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. In addition to our three China retail marketplaces, we operate Alibaba.com, China’s largest global wholesale marketplace in 2013 by revenue, according to iResearch, 1688.com, our China wholesale marketplace, and AliExpress, our global consumer marketplace, as well as provide cloud computing services. 
<br><br>
We provide the fundamental technology infrastructure and marketing reach to help businesses leverage the power of the Internet to establish an online presence and conduct commerce with consumers and businesses. We have been a leader in developing online marketplace standards in China, including consumer protection programs, marketplace rules, qualification standards for merchants, and buyer and seller rating systems. Given the scale we have been able to achieve, an ecosystem has developed around our platform that consists of buyers, sellers, third-party service providers, strategic alliance partners, and investee companies. Our platform and the role we play in connecting buyers and sellers and making it possible for them to do business anytime and anywhere is at the nexus of this ecosystem. Much of our effort, our time and our energy is spent on initiatives that are for the greater good of the ecosystem and the various participants in it. We feel a strong responsibility for the continued development of the ecosystem and we take ownership for this development. Accordingly, we refer to this as “our ecosystem.” 
<br><br>
Consumers and businesses benefit from our ecosystem because they can access products and services with a combination of selection, value, quality, convenience and customer experience that is not available elsewhere. Merchants are enabled by our tools and infrastructure to do business and flourish on our platform. Other participants in our ecosystem C including marketing affiliates, logistics providers, independent software vendors and various professional service providers C provide valuable services to our buyer and seller customers. Our ecosystem has strong self-reinforcing network effects that benefit our marketplace participants, who are invested in our ecosystem’s growth and success. 
<br><br>
We have experienced significant growth across various metrics for our China retail marketplaces: 
<br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">Key Marketplaces and Services </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Our marketplaces and services include the following: 

<br><br>
<a href= "pic38.html">Key Marketplaces and Services</a><br><br>
Cloud Computing and Internet Infrastructure <br><br>

Alibaba Cloud Computing offers a complete suite of cloud computing services, including elastic computing, database services and storage and large scale computing services for our platforms and the platforms of our related companies, such as Alipay, to sellers on our marketplaces, and other third-party customers, such as start-up companies in mobile applications and Internet gaming to established corporations in digital entertainment, consumer electronics, financial services, mobile communications, healthcare and education. We also provide Internet infrastructure services, such as web hosting and domain name registration. <br><br>

Our Monetization Model 
<br><br>
The revenue we generate on our retail marketplaces is highly correlated to the amount of GMV transacted and the revenue on our wholesale marketplaces is largely driven by the number of paying members. We primarily derive revenue from online marketing services, where sellers pay us marketing fees to acquire user traffic, as well as from commissions based on GMV for transactions settled through Alipay. As described below, our marketing services are primarily performance-based, using market-based bidding systems so that each merchant determines the price it is willing to pay for such services. The price a merchant is willing to pay for marketing services generally depends on the merchant’s expected GMV, profit margins and lifetime value of customers derived from such marketing investment. 
<br><br>
China Commerce Retail. We generate revenue from our China retail marketplaces C Taobao Marketplace, Tmall and Juhuasuan C primarily through the following monetization models: 
<br><br>
 

--Online Marketing Services. Online marketing services consist of:  
<br><br>
Pay-for-performance, or P4P, marketing services, where sellers bid for keywords that match product or service listings appearing in search or browser results on a cost-per-click, or CPC, basis at prices established by our online auction system, which facilitates price discovery through a market-based bidding mechanism. P4P marketing services are provided both on our marketplaces as well as through third-party marketing affiliates; 
<br><br>
Display marketing, where sellers bid for display positions on the relevant marketplaces or through our third-party marketing affiliates at fixed prices or prices established by a real-time bidding system on a cost-per-thousand impression, or CPM, basis; 
<br><br>
Taobaoke program, where sellers on Taobao Marketplace and Tmall pay us commissions based on a percentage of GMV for transactions settled through Alipay from users sourced from third-party marketing affiliates; and 
<br><br>
Placement Services, where sellers pay placement fees to purchase promotional slots on our Juhuasuan marketplace for a specified period; 
<br><br>
 

--Commissions on Transactions. In addition to purchasing online marketing services, sellers on Tmall and Juhuasuan also pay a commission based on a percentage of GMV for transactions settled through Alipay in the respective marketplaces. The commission percentages typically range from 0.5% to 5% depending on the product category; and  
<br><br>
 

--Storefront Fees. Our revenue from storefront fees is primarily comprised of monthly subscription fees for Wangpu ( LOGO ), our storefront software that includes a suite of tools that assist sellers in upgrading, decorating and managing their storefronts.  <br><br>

The following table shows the primary types of revenue generated on our China retail marketplaces and the relevant type of customer that generates such revenues: 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic39.html">revenue generated on our China retail marketplaces </a><br><br>


China Commerce Wholesale. We generate revenue from our China wholesale marketplace C 1688.com C primarily through: 
<br><br>
 

--Fees from Memberships and Value-added Services. Revenue from our China wholesale marketplace is primarily generated from the sale of China TrustPass memberships, which allow wholesalers to host premium storefronts, with access to basic data analytic applications, and upgraded storefront management tools, as well as from value-added services, such as premium data analytics.  
<br><br>
 

--Online Marketing Services.Revenue from online marketing services on our China wholesale marketplace is derived from P4P marketing services and keyword bidding.  
<br><br>
International Commerce Retail. We generate revenue from our international commerce retail marketplaces, primarily AliExpress, through commissions, which are generally 5% of GMV for transactions settled through Alipay. 
<br><br>
International Commerce Wholesale. We generate revenue from our global wholesale marketplaces C Alibaba.com C primarily through: 

 <br><br>

--Fees from Membership and Value-added Services. Revenue from our global wholesale marketplace is primarily generated from the sale of our Gold Supplier memberships on Alibaba.com, which allow wholesalers to host premium storefronts, with product listings on the marketplace, as well as value-added services, such as product showcase, custom clearance, value-added tax, or VAT, refund and other import/export business solutions.  

 <br><br>

--Online Marketing Services. Revenue from online marketing services on our global wholesale marketplaces is primarily derived from P4P marketing services.  
<br><br>
Cloud Computing and Internet Infrastructure. We generate revenue from cloud computing and Internet infrastructure services primarily from the time- and usage-based provision of cloud computing services, such as elastic computing, database services and storage and large scale computing services, as well as from web-hosting and domain name registration. 
<br><br>
Others. We generate revenue from other services that we provide to our marketplace participants, including micro-finance services through our SME loan business.

	<b><a name="T10">Our operating philosophy </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Our operating philosophy is to manage our various business units to a single profit and loss, or “P&L,” rather than setting compartmentalized P&L targets for each business unit. We believe placing specific financial targets, such as revenue, margin or profit, for individual businesses or managers would create barriers against cooperation, damages the network effects among our marketplaces and negatively impacts the long-term profit potential of our business. We instead ask our managers to be accountable for operating metrics that reflect the health of our marketplaces and the contribution of their units to our entire business. We believe this approach is consistent with the spirit of the Alibaba Partnership as it closely aligns interests, encourages collaboration and focuses leaders on building a sustainable and thriving ecosystem.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T11">Factors Affecting our Results of Operations </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Number and Engagement of Buyers and Sellers and GMV Transacted on Our Marketplaces. Buyers are attracted to our marketplaces by the breadth and depth of product listings, the attractive online shopping experience and the convenient and secure payment and escrow services offered by Alipay. Sellers are attracted to our marketplaces by our strong user traffic as well as the marketing, cloud computing, sourcing, data and communications services we offer, which allow them to effectively target potential buyers and operate more efficiently. The GMV transacted on our marketplaces is driven by the level of user traffic visiting our marketplaces, buyer engagement and activity on our marketplaces, the relevance of product or service listings when a user searches or browses our content and the number of product categories from which buyers purchase products and services. 
<br><br>
Our Ability to Achieve and Increase Monetization. 
<br><br>
Retail marketplaces. We generate our revenue from monetization models that include online marketing services, such as P4P marketing services, as well as commissions based on a percentage of GMV transacted on Tmall, Juhuasuan and AliExpress and settled through Alipay. Our ability to increase monetization will be affected by a number of factors, including the GMV mix between Taobao Marketplace and Tmall, and the category mix of GMV transacted on our marketplaces. Our ability to increase revenues will be positively affected as the GMV contribution of Tmall increases as a portion of total GMV because merchants on Tmall generally pay marketing service fees in addition to commissions, and, accordingly, average revenue for the same amount of GMV transacted is higher for Tmall than for Taobao Marketplace. 
<br><br>
Monetization of our mobile platforms. The increasing use of mobile devices to access our marketplaces requires us to develop new monetization methods for mobile interfaces. The success of this effort will be increasingly important to the extent shopping on mobile devices displaces transactions that could have occurred on personal computers. We expect mobile GMV as a percentage of total GMV will grow and that our monetization rates for mobile interfaces in the near term will be lower than those we have achieved from websites because our current focus is not on maximizing short-term mobile monetization. Instead, we are focused on increasing mobile GMV and user activity and improving the mobile user experience as well as experimenting with various methods of mobile monetization to test their effectiveness. Over time, we expect the increasing use of mobile devices to have a positive impact on our business as: 
<br><br>
 

--we enhance our mobile-based marketing products for sellers,  

 <br><br>

--we realize the benefits associated with the increased convenience of mobile shopping,<br><br> 
--our sellers utilize the ability of our mobile shopping apps to provide more personalized and targeted marketing messages to buyers, including location-based promotions,  
<br><br>
 

--our mobile shopping apps make it easier to do business anywhere, anytime and  

 <br><br>

--payment apps developed by Alipay facilitate seamless mobile transactions.  
<br><br>
Wholesale Marketplaces. Revenue on our wholesale markets C 1688.com and Alibaba.com C is primarily driven by the number of paying members, membership renewal rates and other value-added marketing services we provide to members. The number of buyers using our wholesale marketplaces will affect sellers’ willingness to purchase and renew membership packages with us and to use our marketing services. We periodically review ways to increase value for our participants and create new monetization opportunities for our wholesale marketplaces. 
<br><br>
Operating Leverage of Our Marketplace Business Model. Our marketplace business model has significant operating leverage, particularly for our retail marketplace businesses. Our business model enables us to avoid the costs, risks and capital requirements associated with sourcing merchandise or holding inventory. Due to the large number of buyers on our marketplaces, we are able to attract a large number of sellers, which in turn provides a strong source for our online marketing and storefront services. In addition, sellers purchase marketing services through a self-service platform on our China retail marketplaces. As a result, we do not rely on a field sales force to generate revenue from our China retail marketplaces. <br><br>

Our Investment in User Base, Technology, People and Infrastructure. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in our platform and ecosystem to attract consumers and businesses, enhance user experience and expand the capabilities and scope of our marketplaces. We expect our investments will include developing and marketing new online and mobile products and services, enhancing our cloud computing business, including Yun OS, and developing new tools and enablers to attract additional buyers and sellers to our marketplaces. We will also invest in our people, particularly engineers, scientists and product management personnel, as well as in our underlying technology infrastructure. These investments will be a key driver of our long-term growth and competitiveness, but will lead to lower margins. 
<br><br>
Strategic Investments and Acquisitions. We have made, and intend to continue to make, strategic investments and acquisitions to expand our user base and add complementary products and technologies. For example, we expect to continue to make strategic investments and acquisitions relating to mobile, O2O services, digital media and category expansion as well as logistics services. Our strategic investments and acquisitions may affect our future financial results.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T12">Components of Results of Operations</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Revenue <br><br>

The following table sets forth the principal components of our revenue for the periods indicated: 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic40.html">Revenue</a><br><br>
We generate substantially all of our revenue from our retail and wholesale marketplaces. We also earn revenue from services associated with our cloud computing and Internet infrastructure business as well as other revenue primarily consisting of interest income generated by our SME loan business. See “― Our Monetization Model” above. Substantially all of our revenue is attributable to our businesses in China. 
<br><br>
Cost of Revenue <br><br>

The principal components of our cost of revenue include: payment processing fees paid to Alipay or other financial institutions; traffic acquisition costs paid to third-party marketing affiliates either at a fixed price or on a revenue sharing basis; expenses associated with the operation of our websites, such as bandwidth and co-location fees and depreciation and maintenance expenses for our computers, servers, call center and other equipment; salary, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense relating to customer service and web operation personnel and payment processing consultants; unit-volume driven rebates; business taxes and related surcharges; and allowance for doubtful accounts in relation to the micro loans. Due to tax reform in China that replaced the business tax with VAT, which is netted against revenue, business tax is no longer a significant part of cost of revenues starting from late fiscal year 2013. <br><br>

Product Development Expenses 
<br><br>
Product development expenses primarily include salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense for our employees engaged in the development, maintenance and enhancement of the infrastructure, applications, operating systems, software, databases and networks for our marketplaces, mobile products and service platforms. In addition, product development expenses include royalty fees paid to Yahoo pursuant to the
Yahoo TIPLA. These royalty fees will terminate upon the completion of this offering. We expense all of our product development costs as they are incurred. 
<br><br>
Sales and Marketing Expenses 
<br><br>
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of online and offline marketing expenses, promotion expenses, sales commissions paid for membership acquisition for our wholesale marketplaces, and salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense for our employees engaged in sales and marketing functions. 
<br><br>
General and Administrative Expenses 
<br><br>
General and administrative expenses consist mainly of salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense for our management and administrative employees, professional services fees, office facilities, other support overhead costs and charitable contributions. In the nine months ended December 31, 2013, these expenses included an equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 million (US$204 million) relating to the grant of options to purchase 50,000,000 of our ordinary shares to a non-profit organization designated by Jack Ma and Joe Tsai. As there are no vesting conditions attached to the above share options, equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 million (US$204 million) was recognized in full. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for further information on this expense. 
<br><br>
Other Income, Net 
<br><br>
Other income, net primarily consists of royalty fees and software technology service fees paid by Alipay as well as government grants. See “Related Party Transactions” for further information on the arrangements between us and Alipay. Government grants primarily relate to grants by central and local governments in connection with our contributions to technology development and investments in local business districts. These grants may not be recurring in nature, and we recognize such income when the grants are received and no further conditions need to be met. 
<br><br>
Interest Expense 
<br><br>
Our interest expense is comprised of interest payments, incidental charges associated with our bank borrowings and dividends on our redeemable preference shares. Our interest expense became more significant starting from fiscal year 2013 as a result of our previous US$4.0 billion credit facility, which was used to fund our privatization of Alibaba.com and to partially finance the repurchase of our ordinary shares from Yahoo in September 2012, and the payment of dividends on the US$800 million redeemable preference shares we issued to Yahoo in September 2012. We have also incurred interest expense and transaction costs in connection with the US$8.0 billion credit facility that we obtained in April 2013, of which as of December 31, 2013, US$5.0 billion had been drawn down. The US$8.0 billion credit facility has a lower average interest rate than that of the US$4.0 billion credit facility. We drew down the remaining US$3.0 billion in April 2014. 
<br><br>
Income Tax Expense 
<br><br>
Our income tax expense is comprised primarily of current tax expense, mainly attributable to certain profitable subsidiaries in China, and deferred tax expense, mainly including withholding tax on dividends to be distributed by our major subsidiaries operating in China. 
<br><br>
Taxation 
<br><br>
Cayman Islands Profits Tax 
<br><br>
Under Cayman Islands law, our company is not subject to income, corporation or capital gains tax, and no withholding tax is imposed upon the payment of dividends. 
<br><br>
Hong Kong Profits Tax 
<br><br>
Our company’s subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong were subject to Hong Kong profits tax rate of 16.5% in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013. 
<br><br>
PRC Income Tax 
<br><br>
Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, the standard enterprise income tax rate is 25%. Entities qualifying as High and New Technology Enterprises enjoy a preferential tax rate of 15%. Entities recognized as Software Enterprises are exempt from the EIT for two years beginning from their first profitable year and are entitled to a 50% reduction in EIT for the following three years. Furthermore, entities recognized as key software enterprises within the PRC national plan enjoy a preferential EIT rate of 10%. Certain subsidiaries received the above preferential tax treatments during fiscal years 2012 and 2013. One of our major subsidiaries in China is currently in its third profitable year, and as a result is no longer fully exempt from paying EIT but will be subject to EIT rate of 12.5% (or 50% of the standard statutory rate) in fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016. Accordingly, we expect our effective tax rate to increase in fiscal year 2014. 
<br><br>
Business Tax, VAT and Other Levies 
<br><br>
Our PRC subsidiaries were subject to business tax and related surcharges on the revenue earned for services provided in China. The applicable business tax rate was 5%. In our consolidated income statement, business tax and related surcharges for revenue earned from customers are recognized as cost of revenue. Effectively starting from late fiscal year 2013, our major PRC subsidiaries became subject to VAT on revenue earned for most services under a national VAT reform program which replaced the business tax regime in China. In general, the applicable VAT rate on the revenue earned for services is 6% with companies entitled to credit VAT paid on certain purchases against VAT on sales. Revenue is recognized net of VAT in our consolidated income statement. 
<br><br>
PRC Withholding Tax 
<br><br>
Pursuant to the EIT Law, a 10% withholding tax is generally levied on dividends declared by companies in China to their non-resident enterprise investors. A lower withholding tax rate of 5% is applicable for direct foreign investors incorporated in Hong Kong with at least a 25% equity interest in the PRC company and who meet the relevant conditions or requirements pursuant to the tax arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong. As the equity holders of our major subsidiaries in China are qualified Hong Kong incorporated companies, our deferred tax liabilities for distributable earnings are calculated based on a 5% withholding tax. 
<br><br>
Share-based Compensation 
<br><br>
We have various equity incentive plans pursuant to which our employees, consultants and other grantees, including certain employees of our related companies and affiliate who perform services for us, are granted options or awarded RSUs to acquire our ordinary shares. We believe share-based awards are vital to attract, motivate and retain our employees, and in the case of grants to non-employees, to more closely align their interests with ours. In addition to on-hire grants for new recruits above a specific job level, we also make performance grants and promotion grants on an annual basis to our top performing employees. RSUs and share options granted in the above categories are generally subject to a four-year vesting schedule. Depending on the nature and the purpose of the grant, share options and RSUs generally vest 25% upon the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date or 50% upon the second anniversary of the vesting commencement date, and thereafter 25% every year. We believe share-based awards are the appropriate tool to align the interests of the grantees with those of our shareholders. 
<br><br>
We recognized share-based compensation expense of RMB1,254 million, RMB1,259 million (US$203 million) and RMB1,919 million (US$309 million) in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, respectively, representing 6.3%, 3.6% and 4.7% of our revenue in those respective periods. Share-based compensation expense is affected by the fair value of our shares, including in the case of share-based awards to non-employees, changes in the fair value of our shares over the requisite service period, which could result in fluctuations in share-based compensation expense for the unvested portion of any award, and the quantity of awards granted. See “― Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates ― Share-based Compensation Expense and Valuation of Our Ordinary Shares” for additional information regarding our share-based compensation expense.

	<b><a name="T13">Recent Investment, Acquisition and Strategic Alliance Activities </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
In addition to organic growth, we have made, or have entered into agreements to make strategic investments, acquisitions and alliances that are intended to increase our service offerings and expand our capabilities. The financial results for these strategic transactions that were completed are reflected in our operating results beginning with the period of their respective completion. Minority investments are accounted for under the equity method if we have significant influence through investment in common stock or in-substance common stock over the investees, or otherwise under the cost method. 
<br><br>
Our significant recent and pending strategic investments and acquisitions are set forth below and are categorized by area of focus.

In addition, we will establish a joint venture with Intime, in which we will hold an 80% interest, to develop an O2O business in China relating to shopping malls, department stores and supermarkets.

The loan to Mr. Xie will be made at an interest rate of 8% per annum and is repayable in ten years. The loan will be collateralized by Mr. Xie’s equity interest in the partnership and by the shares of Wasu held by such partnership.

We paid the total purchase price of HK$932 million upon the closing of the transaction. 
<br><br>
Logistics 
<br><br>
Zhejiang Cainiao Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd., which we refer to as China Smart Logistics, an operator of a nationwide logistics infrastructure and information system. In May 2013, we joined with other partners and logistics services businesses in China to form a joint venture to build and operate China Smart Logistics. Other equity partners in China Smart Logistics include five major express delivery companies in China that provide services on our China retail marketplaces, as well as firms specializing in real estate development. We now own 48% of the joint venture and will subscribe for our proportionate share of the joint venture’s RMB5,000 million registered capital, or RMB2,400 million.

Acquired Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
<br><br>
We have and will continue to incur amortization expenses as we amortize acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful life. We do not amortize our goodwill. We test intangible assets and goodwill periodically for impairment, and any such impairment may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Some of our acquisitions and investments may not be successful, and we may incur impairment charges in the future. For additional information, see “― Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates ― Impairment Assessment on Goodwill and Intangible Assets” and “Risk Factors ― Risks Related to Our Business and Industry ― We face risks relating to our acquisitions, investments and alliances.”

	<b><a name="T15">Comparison of Nine Months Ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Revenue<br><br>

<a href= "pic42.html">Revenue</a><br><br>
Total revenue increased by 56.6%, from RMB25,843 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB40,473 million (US$6,511 million) in the same period in 2013. The increase was mainly driven by the 
<br><br>

continued rapid growth of our China commerce retail business. Our revenue growth rate will likely decline as our revenue grows to higher levels. 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic43.html">China Commerce</a><br><br>
 
Revenue from our China commerce retail business increased by 65.5% from RMB20,216 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB33,461 million (US$5,383 million) in the same period in 2013. The primary factors affecting revenue growth during this period were an increase of 59.4% in GMV transacted on these marketplaces and the beneficial impact of the increased proportion of GMV transacted on Tmall. The benefit of increased GMV transacted in the period was less pronounced than in prior periods due to the strong growth in mobile GMV, which we are monetizing at a lower rate. 
<br><br>
Revenue from our China commerce wholesale business remained largely stable at RMB1,709 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 compared to RMB1,706 million (US$274 million) in the same period in 2013 as the number of paying members remained relatively stable between the periods. 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic44.html">International Commerce</a><br><br>
Revenue from our international commerce retail business increased by 147.3% from RMB264 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB653 million (US$105 million) in the same period in 2013. The main reason for this increase was an increase in GMV transacted on AliExpress, primarily from sales to buyers in Russia, the United States and Brazil. 
<br><br>
Revenue from our international commerce wholesale business increased by 1.8% from RMB2,853 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB2,904 million (US$467 million) in the same period in 2013. The modest increase in revenue was due to an increase in the number of paying members. 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic45.html">Cost of Revenue </a><br><br>
Our cost of revenue increased by 33.0% from RMB7,442 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB9,899 million (US$1,592 million) in the same period in 2013. This increase was primarily due to increases of RMB918 million in payroll and benefits expense, including share-based compensation expense, an increase of RMB820 million in payment processing fees resulting from an increase in GMV transacted on our retail marketplaces, an increase of RMB734 million in bandwidth and co-location fees and depreciation expense mainly as a result of increased user traffic on our websites and an increase of RMB426 million in traffic acquisition costs as a result of the expansion of our third-party marketing affiliate programs, partially offset by a decrease of RMB796 million in business tax resulting from the replacement of business tax with VAT, which is netted against revenue. We expect our cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollar amounts and will likely increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to invest in our business, customer service initiatives and infrastructure. 
<br><br>
Product Development Expenses <br><br>
<a href= "pic46.html">Product Development Expenses</a><br><br>
Our product development expenses increased by 34.3% from RMB2,899 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB3,893 million (US$626 million) in the same period in 2013. The increase was largely due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses, including share-based compensation expense, and an increase in the royalty fee paid to Yahoo. The increased royalty fee was driven by the increase in our revenue and partially offset by a decrease in the royalty fee rate pursuant to the amended Yahoo TIPLA in September 2012. Following completion of our initial public offering, we will no longer pay royalty fees to Yahoo. We expect our product development expenses will increase in absolute amounts and may over time increase as a percentage of revenues. 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic47.html">Sales and Marketing Expenses </a><br><br>
Our sales and marketing expenses increased by 5.7% from RMB3,092 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB3,267 million (US$526 million) in the same period in 2013. The increase was primarily due to increased online marketing and promotional spending to promote Taobao Marketplace and Tmall as well as increased sales commissions to third-party sales agents mainly in connection with our wholesale marketplaces. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute amounts and will likely increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to invest in marketing and promotion. 
 <br><br>
<a href= "pic48.html">General and Administrative Expenses </a><br><br>
Our general and administrative expenses increased by 58.0% from RMB2,344 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB3,704 million (US$596 million) in the same period in 2013. The increase was primarily due to a one-time equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 million (US$204 million) in the nine months ended December 31, 2013 relating to the grant of options to purchase 50,000,000 of our ordinary shares to a non-profit organization designated by Jack Ma and Joe Tsai. The increase was also due to increases in professional services fees as well as increases in payroll and benefits expenses, including share-based compensation expense, partially offset by decreases in office facilities and other overhead costs. 
<br><br>
Yahoo TIPLA Amendment Payment 
<br><br>
We entered into the Yahoo TIPLA in October 2005, pursuant to which we pay royalty fees to Yahoo. We and Yahoo amended the then existing TIPLA in September 2012, pursuant to which we made a lump sum payment to Yahoo in the amount of US$550 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2012. 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic49.html">Income from Operations and Operating Margin</a><br><br>
Our income from operations increased significantly from RMB6,299 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB19,469 million (US$3,132 million) in the same period in 2013. The increase was primarily due to the overall growth in our revenue and from our revenue growing faster than the increases in our cost of revenue and expenses during the same period. Our income from operations in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 were affected by one-time expense items consisting of the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment and an equity-settled donation expense, respectively. 
<br><br>
Our operating margin increased from 24.4% in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 (taking into account the one-time Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment, which amounted to 13.5% as a percentage of revenue) to 48.1% in the same period in 2013 (taking into account the one-time equity-settled donation expense, which amounted to 3.1% as a percentage of revenue). The increase was primarily attributable to increases in our revenue without a corresponding significant increase in costs as we continued to benefit from the ongoing network effects of our online marketplaces and a highly scalable business model, as well as the effects of tax reform in China that replaced the business tax with VAT. 
<br><br>
Interest and Investment Income (Loss), Net 
<br><br>
We had a net interest and investment loss of RMB25 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 compared to a net interest and investment gain of RMB1,080 million (US$174 million) in the same period in 2013. The change was primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher cash balances during the period, a gain from our disposal of a subsidiary and a decrease in impairment loss of equity investments. 
<br><br>
Interest Expense 
<br><br>
Our interest expense increased by 65.5% from RMB1,113 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB1,842 million (US$296 million) in the same period in 2013, primarily due to charges incurred in connection with the refinancing of our US$4.0 billion credit facility and a higher average loan amount outstanding during the period following entry into our US$8.0 billion credit facility in April 2013, of which US$5.0 billion was immediately drawn down, partially offset by a lower overall interest rate during that period. 
<br><br>
Other Income, Net 
<br><br>
Our other income, net increased by 98.7% from RMB593 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB1,178 million (US$189 million) in the same period in 2013, primarily due to an increase in royalty fees and software technology service fees received from Alipay as a result of an increase in the volume of transactions processed by, and the pre-tax income of, Alipay. 
<br><br>
Income Tax Expenses 
<br><br>
Our income tax expenses increased by 44.6% from RMB1,362 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB1,969 million (US$317 million) in the same period in 2013, primarily due to the increase in taxable profit from our operations in China. While the PRC EIT law imposes a unified enterprise income tax rate of 25% for both domestic enterprises and foreign invested enterprises, a number of our operating entities have enjoyed various tax incentives, such as the preferential tax rate of 15% granted to entities qualifying as High and New Technology Enterprises and a preferential tax rate of 10% granted to entities qualifying as key software enterprises. Our effective tax rate was 23.7% and 9.9% in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively. The one-time Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment made in 2012 did not reduce our taxable income and we were not able to use it to offset our taxable income. 
<br><br>
Net Income 
<br><br>
As a result of the foregoing, our net income increased significantly from RMB4,383 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB17,742 million (US$2,854 million) in the same period in 2013. Net income in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 was also reduced by the one-time Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment. 
<br><br>
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest 
<br><br>
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest mainly represents the net income of Alibaba.com attributable to its public shareholders prior to its privatization in June 2012. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased by 73.1% from RMB108 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 to RMB29 million (US$5 million) in the same period in 2013, as there was no further net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related to Alibaba.com after the completion of its privatization.

<a href= "pic50.html">Revenue</a><br><br>
Total revenue increased by 72.4% from RMB20,025 million in fiscal year 2012 to RMB34,517 million (US$5,553 million) in fiscal year 2013. The increase was primarily driven by our rapidly growing China commerce retail business.

Revenue growth during this period was primarily due to an increase of 62.0% in GMV transacted on these marketplaces, an increased proportion of GMV transacted on Tmall, the commencement of monetization of Juhuasuan in fiscal year 2013 (we launched Juhuasuan in 2010) and increased demand for online marketing services. <br><br>

Revenue from our China commerce wholesale business was RMB2,215 million in fiscal year 2012 and RMB2,197 million (US$353 million) in fiscal year 2013, as the number of paying members remained relatively stable between the periods.<br><br>

Revenue from our international commerce wholesale business increased by 6.4% from RMB3,542 million in fiscal year 2012 to RMB3,768 million (US$606 million) in fiscal year 2013. Revenue growth during this period was primarily due to an increase in the average revenue we generated from each member resulting from higher sales of value-added services. 
<br><br>
 
<a href= "pic53.html">Cost of Revenue </a><br><br>
Our cost of revenue increased by 48.3% from RMB6,554 million in fiscal year 2012 to RMB9,719 million (US$1,563 million) in fiscal year 2013.

<a href= "pic54.html">Product Development Expenses </a><br><br>
Our product development expenses increased by 29.5% from RMB2,897 million in fiscal year 2012 to RMB3,753 million (US$604 million) in fiscal year 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits costs, including share-based compensation expense, and an increase in royalty fees paid to Yahoo driven by an increase in our revenue. 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic55.html">Sales and Marketing Expenses</a><br><br>
Our sales and marketing expenses increased by 18.1% from RMB3,058 million in fiscal year 2012 to RMB3,613 million (US$581 million) in fiscal year 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in online marketing and promotional spending to strengthen marketing of our Taobao Marketplace and Tmall brands, as well as an increase in payroll and benefits costs, including share-based compensation expense and commissions paid to our sales staff. <br><br>

<a href= "pic56.html">General and Administrative Expenses</a><br><br>
Our general and administrative expenses increased by 30.7% from RMB2,211 million in fiscal year 2012 to RMB2,889 million (US$465 million) in fiscal year 2013. The increase was primarily due to the increase in payroll and benefits expenses, including share-based compensation expense, partially offset by the decrease in professional services fees. 
<br><br>
Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets <br><br>

We conduct impairment assessments of our goodwill and intangible assets annually. In fiscal years 2012 and 2013, we concluded that the carrying amounts of certain reporting units exceeded their fair value and recorded an impairment charge of RMB135 million (US$22 million) and RMB175 million (US$28 million), respectively. 
<br><br>
Yahoo TIPLA Amendment Payment <br><br>

Pursuant to the Yahoo TIPLA amendment, we made a lump sum payment in the amount of US$550 million in fiscal year 2013. 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic57.html">Income from Operations and Operating Margin</a><br><br>
Our income from operations increased by 114.4% from RMB5,015 million in fiscal year 2012 to RMB10,751 million (US$1,730 million) in fiscal year 2013. The increase was primarily due to the overall growth in our revenue and due to our revenue growing faster than the increases in our cost of revenue and expenses during the same period, taking into account the one-time Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment made in fiscal year 2013 as discussed above. 
<br><br>
Our operating margin increased from 25.0% in fiscal year 2012 to 31.1% in fiscal year 2013, taking into account the one-time Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment, which amounted to 10.1% as a percentage of revenue. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in our revenue. We also benefited from the network effects of our online marketplaces and a highly scalable business model as well as the effects of tax reform in China that replaced the business tax with VAT.

Interest and Investment Income, Net 
<br><br>
Our net interest and investment income decreased by 84.9% from RMB258 million in fiscal year 2012 to RMB39 million (US$6 million) in fiscal year 2013. The decrease was primarily due to foreign exchange losses and a decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by investment gains resulting from changes in the fair value of our investment securities held for trading. <br><br>

Interest Expense <br><br>

Our interest expense increased significantly from RMB68 million in fiscal year 2012 to RMB1,572 million (US$253 million) in fiscal year 2013, primarily due to an increase in borrowings to partially finance the privatization of Alibaba.com in June 2012 and repurchase of our ordinary shares from Yahoo in September 2012, as well as dividends paid on redeemable preference shares issued to Yahoo in September 2012, which we redeemed in May 2013.

Our other income, net, increased by 173.4% from RMB327 million in fiscal year 2012 to RMB894 million (US$144 million) in fiscal year 2013.

	<b><a name="T17">Quarterly Results of Operations </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the seven quarters from April 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013. The unaudited quarterly statement of operations data set forth below have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited annual consolidated financial statements and we believe includes all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial information contained in those statements. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. The following quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. <br><br>

<a href= "pic58.html">Quarterly Results of Operations </a><br><br>
The following table sets forth our quarterly results of operations as a percentage of revenues of the relevant period. <br><br>
<a href= "pic59.html">Quarterly Results of Operations</a><br><br>
The following table sets forth GMV and the percentage of mobile GMV transacted on our China retail marketplaces during the relevant period. <br><br>


<a href= "pic60.html"> GMV and the percentage of mobile GMV</a><br><br>
Quarterly Trends 
<br><br>
Our overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including seasonal factors and economic cycles that influence consumer spending as well as promotional shopping activities we conduct. 
<br><br>
Historically, we have experienced the highest levels of revenues in the fourth calendar quarter of each year due to a number of factors, including sellers allocating a significant portion of their online marketing budgets to the fourth calendar quarter, promotions, such as Singles Day on November 11 of each year, the holiday season in China and the impact of seasonal buying patterns in respect of certain categories such as apparel. Historically, we have also experienced lower levels of revenues in the first calendar quarter of each year primarily due to the Chinese New Year holiday, during which time consumers generally spend less and businesses in China are generally closed. In addition, seasonal weather patterns may affect the timing of buying decisions. For example, unexpectedly long periods of warm weather could delay the purchase of heavier clothing items that have higher average selling prices, resulting in lower than expected GMV. During the quarter ended December 31, 2012, we generated revenues of RMB11,593 million, which represented 33.6% of our revenues in fiscal year 2013, and during the quarter ended December 31, 2013, we generated revenues of RMB18,745 million (US$3,015 million). The net loss of RMB1,560 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2012 was due to the one-time Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment of US$550 million. The decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue starting from the quarter ended December 31, 2012 was mainly due to the replacement of business tax with VAT, which is netted against revenue, and due to increased operating leverage of our marketplace business model. The quarter-over-quarter increase of RMB1,253 million in general and administrative expenses during the quarter ended December 31, 2013 was due to a one-time equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 million (US$204 million). <br><br>

Our business is directly affected by the behavior of buyers and sellers on our marketplaces as well as overall consumer sentiment and activity levels. Consequently, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating or financial performance. <br><br>

	<b><a name="T18">Liquidity and Capital Resources </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We fund our operations primarily from cash generated from our operations. As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB41,714 million (US$6,710 million) and RMB7,248 million (US$1,166 million), respectively. Short-term investments consist of fixed deposits with maturities between three months and one year. 
<br><br>
The following table sets out a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated. <br><br>
<a href= "pic61.html">Liquidity and Capital Resources</a><br><br>
We believe that our current levels of cash and cash flows from operations and from existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, we may need additional cash resources in the future if we find and wish to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition, strategic cooperation or other similar actions, which may include investing in technology, our underlying technical infrastructure, including data management and analytics solutions, or related talent. If we determine that our cash requirements exceed our amounts of cash on hand, we may seek to issue debt or equity securities or obtain additional credit facilities or other sources of funding. <br><br>

Cash Provided by Operating Activities <br><br>

Cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended December 31, 2013 was RMB24,579 million (US$3,954 million) and primarily consisted of net income of RMB17,742 million (US$2,854 million), as adjusted for non-cash items and the effects of changes in working capital and other activities. Adjustment for non-cash items primarily included RMB1,919 million (US$309 million) of share-based compensation expense, RMB1,269 million (US$204 million) of equity-settled donation expense and RMB1,141 million (US$184 million) of deferred income taxes. Changes in working capital and other activities primarily consisted of an increase of RMB4,796 million (US$772 million) in merchant deposits, which relate to merchants operating on Tmall, and an increase of RMB4,526 million (US$728 million) in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as a result of the growth of our business, partially offset by an increase of RMB8,367 million (US$1,346 million) in loan receivables as a result of the continued growth of our SME loan business. 
<br><br>
Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2013 was RMB14,476 million (US$2,329 million) and primarily consisted of net income of RMB8,649 million (US$1,392 million), as adjusted for non-cash items and the effects of changes in working capital and other activities. Adjustment for non-cash items primarily included RMB1,259 million (US$203 million) of share-based compensation expense and RMB805 million (US$129 million) of depreciation and amortization expenses. Changes in working capital and other activities primarily consisted of an increase of RMB3,657 million (US$588 million) in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as a result of the growth of our business and an increase of RMB2,338 million (US$376 million) in merchants deposits, which relate to merchants operating on Tmall, partially offset by an increase of RMB2,828 million (US$455 million) in loan receivables as a result of the growth of our SME loan business.

Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2012 was RMB9,275 million and primarily consisted of net income of RMB4,665 million, as adjusted for non-cash items and the effects of changes in working capital and other activities. Adjustment for non-cash items primarily included RMB1,254 million of share-based compensation expense, RMB715 million of depreciation and amortization expenses and RMB138 million of realized and unrealized loss on investment securities. Changes in working capital and other activities primarily consisted of an increase of RMB1,332 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as a result of the growth of our business and headcount, and an increase of RMB583 million in merchants deposits, which relate to merchants operating on Tmall. 
<br><br>
Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities 
<br><br>
Cash used in investing activities was RMB22,192 million (US$3,570 million) in the nine months ended December 31, 2013 and was primarily attributable to RMB11,934 million (US$1,920 million) in equity investments mainly held for strategic purposes, including AutoNavi, Weibo and UCWeb, a net increase in short-term investments of RMB4,965 million (US$799 million) and acquisitions of land use rights, construction in progress and other property, equipment and intangible assets of RMB4,336 million (US$697 million), primarily in connection with the expansion of our corporate campuses and the purchase of computer equipment. 
<br><br>
Cash provided by investing activities was RMB545 million (US$88 million) in fiscal year 2013 and was primarily attributable to a net decrease in short-term investments of RMB2,589 million (US$416 million), and a net decrease in restricted cash of RMB334 million (US$54 million). The net decrease in restricted cash was mainly attributable to the release of restricted cash of RMB1,177 million (US$189 million) from an escrow account following the completion of the Alibaba.com privatization in June 2012 and a release of RMB1,000 million (US$161 million) in deposits for a one-time consumer protection program offered by Tmall that we funded in fiscal year 2012, which was partially offset by the increase in restricted cash of RMB1,884 million (US$303 million) for our debt servicing reserve account required by our US$4.0 billion credit facility drawn in September 2012. These amounts were partially offset by payments for acquisitions of land use rights, construction in progress and other property, equipment and intangible assets of RMB2,503 million (US$402 million) primarily in connection with the expansion of our corporate campuses and the purchase of computer equipment. <br><br>

Cash used in investing activities was RMB125 million in fiscal year 2012 and was primarily attributable to acquisitions of land use rights, construction in progress and other property, equipment and intangible assets of RMB2,168 million primarily in connection with the expansion of our corporate campuses and the purchase of computer equipment, restricted cash of RMB2,108 million, primarily including RMB1,177 million that was put into escrow pending completion of the privatization of Alibaba.com and RMB1,000 million for consumer protection programs offered by Tmall in connection with a one-time program that we funded using our own money for consumer protection, acquisitions of equity investees of RMB761 million, acquisitions of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities of RMB508 million and loans to employees, net of repayments, of RMB305 million. These amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the net decrease in short-term investments of RMB3,728 million and proceeds from disposals of available-for-sale investment securities of RMB1,966 million. <br><br>

Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities 
<br><br>
Cash provided by financing activities was RMB9,046 million (US$1,455 million) in the nine months ended December 31, 2013 and was primarily attributable to a drawdown of RMB29,947 million, or US$5.0 billion, as part of our US$8.0 billion credit facility, RMB24,788 million (US$3,988 million) of which was used for the 
<br><br>
refinancing of the US$4.0 billion bank loan obtained in September 2012 and the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, and RMB5,131 million (US$825 million) of which was used to redeem the Yahoo preference shares and the accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, as well as an increase of RMB6,786 million (US$1,092 million) in borrowings from third-party financial institutions secured by micro loans from our SME loan business. 
<br><br>
Cash used in financing activities was RMB1,406 million (US$226 million) in fiscal year 2013 and was primarily attributable to the repurchase of our ordinary shares from Yahoo of RMB40,111 million (US$6,452 million) and the privatization of Alibaba.com of RMB15,134 million (US$2,435 million). These amounts were partially offset by a drawdown of RMB24,463 million from our US$4.0 billion credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares to third-party investors and through the exercise of options by our employees totaling RMB16,792 million (US$2,701 million), proceeds from the issuance of convertible preference shares issued to third-party investors of RMB10,542 million (US$1,696 million) and an increase of RMB2,098 million (US$337 million) in secured borrowings underlying our transfers of micro loans to third-party financial institutions. 
<br><br>
Cash provided by financing activities was RMB475 million in fiscal year 2012, and was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares in connection with the exercise of options by our employees of RMB618 million, and a net increase in borrowings of RMB121 million. These amounts were offset by payments for the acquisition of shares of Alibaba.com as part of an open market share repurchase program of RMB419 million. 
<br><br>
Contractual Obligations 
<br><br>
The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2013: 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic62.html">Contractual Obligations </a><br><br>
As of December 31, 2013, our bank borrowings consisted of a US$8.0 billion credit facility, of which US$5.0 billion had been drawn down. We subsequently drew down the remaining US$3.0 billion in April 2014. The interest rate for this credit facility is calculated based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The facility was entered into for purposes of refinancing a US$4.0 billion credit facility entered into during fiscal year 2013 and paying any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, redeeming the Yahoo preference shares together with any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Bank borrowings are secured by equity interests in our major offshore subsidiaries and a pledge of bank deposits of RMB207 million (US$33 million), which are included in restricted cash and escrow receivables. 
<br><br>
Under the terms of our US$8.0 billion credit facility, we are required to maintain certain financial ratios and are subject to certain other covenants. These include a requirement to maintain an offshore group leverage ratio of no more than 3:1 and an interest cover ratio of no less than 4:1. Offshore group leverage is defined as the ratio of total net debt of our company (excluding, among others, indebtedness of project companies and finance companies and deducting offshore cash) less the amount credited to the debt service reserve account to EBITDA, as defined in our credit facility, which differs from the definition of adjusted EBITDA included in this prospectus. Interest cover is defined as the ratio of EBITDA to gross interest paid or payable by our company. We are also restricted from, among other covenants: 
<br><br>
 

--disposing all or a substantial part of any major material subsidiary, which are subsidiaries representing 5% of EBITDA or more;  
<br><br>
 

--maintaining an aggregate outstanding onshore indebtedness of certain subsidiaries of more than RMB9,500 million;  
<br><br>
 

--creating any security interest over assets of Alibaba Group Holding Limited and certain of our subsidiaries;  
<br><br>
 

--engaging in certain financing transactions; and  
<br><br>
 

--changing the general nature of our business.  
<br><br>
In addition, we are required to continue to own 100% of Taobao China Holding Limited and 100% of Alibaba.com China Limited. We are also required to repay the US$8.0 billion credit facility upon a change of control of our company or if it becomes unlawful for a lender to perform its obligations under the credit facility. 
<br><br>
We have entered into arrangements with certain third-party financial institutions under which we transferred the legal title or economic benefits in micro loan receivables in exchange for cash proceeds. We continue to provide management, administration and collection services on the transferred loan receivables and are subject to certain provisions which require us to absorb a portion of the losses incurred in the outstanding portfolio of loan receivables upon an event of default. We are considered to have retained control over the transferred loan receivables due to the existence of such provisions; accordingly such loan receivables did not meet the requirements for asset derecognition. We recognize such loan receivables as pledged assets, and the proceeds received from the transfers are recognized as secured borrowings. Such pledged assets are included in loan receivables totaling RMB9,766 million (US$1,571 million) as of December 31, 2013. 
<br><br>
In addition to our bank borrowings as of December 31, 2013, one of our PRC subsidiaries entered into a RMB1.0 billion loan facility agreement with the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, in April 2014. The principal of the loan will be repayable in twelve months from the drawdown date, and may be extended for an additional twelve months at our option. The loan facility carries interest at a rate based on the lender’s cost of capital plus a spread of 2.25% or 2.75% per annum during the first and second year of the loan period, respectively. Interest payments will be repayable semi-annually in arrears. There is no collateral or guarantee provided by our company for this loan facility. The drawdown of this loan facility has not yet been completed. This loan facility will primarily be used to expand the capital base of our micro loan business. 

<br><br>

Capital Expenditures 
<br><br>
Our capital expenditures have been incurred primarily in relation to (1) the acquisition of land use rights and construction of corporate campuses and office facilities in Hangzhou, Beijing and Shenzhen and (2) the acquisition of computer equipment relating to the operation of our websites, furniture and office equipment and leasehold improvements for our office facilities. In fiscal year 2012, fiscal year 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, our capital expenditures totaled RMB2,168 million, RMB2,503 million (US$402 million) and RMB4,336 million (US$697 million), respectively. <br><br>

Inflation <br><br>

Inflation in China has not materially impacted our results of operations in recent years. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the year-over-year increase in the consumer price index in calendar years 2011, 2012 and 2013 was 5.4%, 2.6% and 2.6%, respectively. Although we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past, we can provide no assurance that we will not be affected in the future by higher inflation rates in China. 
<br><br>
Contingent Liabilities 
<br><br>
As part of the repurchase of a portion of our ordinary shares from Yahoo in September 2012, we agreed to reimburse Yahoo in the event PRC tax is imposed on the capital gains realized by Yahoo in connection with the repurchase, equal to the lesser of (i) one half of the excess of (a) such PRC tax liability over (b) certain tax credits which Yahoo may utilize to reduce the amount of tax imposed in the United States, and (ii) US$100 million (RMB622 million). As of December 31, 2013, given the uncertainty in interpretation of the applicability of PRC tax to the repurchase as well as the magnitude of such capital gain, we have determined that the amount of such payment is not reasonably estimable. As such, we have not accrued any contingent loss in connection with this arrangement as of December 31, 2013. 
<br><br>
Off-balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 
<br><br>
We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements in fiscal year 2012, fiscal year 2013 or the nine months ended December 31, 2013. <br><br>

Holding Company Structure <br><br>

We are a holding company with no operations other than ownership of operating subsidiaries in Hong Kong, China and elsewhere that own and operate our marketplaces and other businesses as well as a portfolio of intellectual property rights. As a result, we rely on dividends and other distributions paid by our operating subsidiaries, including funds to pay dividends to our shareholders or to service our outstanding debts. The terms of our US$8.0 billion credit facility include financial covenants and other restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends. If our operating subsidiaries incur additional debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. In addition, applicable PRC law permits payment of dividends to us by our operating subsidiaries in China only out of their net income, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Moreover, our operating subsidiaries in China are also required to set aside a portion of their net income, if any, each year to fund general reserves for appropriations until such reserve has reached 50% of the related subsidiary’s registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. In addition, registered share capital and capital reserve accounts are also restricted from withdrawal in the PRC, up to the amount of net assets held in each operating subsidiary. As of December 31, 2013, these restricted assets totaled RMB18,408 million (US$2,961 million). See note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. 
<br><br>
Our holding company structure differs from some of our peers in that we hold our material assets and operations, except for ICP and other licenses for regulated activities, in our wholly-foreign owned enterprises and most of our revenue is generated directly by the wholly-foreign owned enterprises. As revenue is generated directly by our wholly-foreign owned enterprises, the wholly-foreign owned enterprises directly capture the profits and associated cash flow from operations, without having to rely on contractual arrangements to transfer such cash flow from the variable interest entities to the wholly-foreign owned enterprises. In fiscal year 2012, fiscal year 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, the significant majority of our revenues were generated by our wholly-foreign owned enterprises in China. See “Our History and Corporate Structure” for a description of these contractual arrangements and the structure of our company.

	<b><a name="T19">Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis about Market Risk </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Foreign Exchange Risk 
<br><br>
Foreign currency risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. Although we operate businesses in different countries, substantially all of our revenue-generating transactions, and a majority of our expense-related transactions, are denominated in Renminbi, which is the functional currency of our major operating subsidiaries and the reporting currency of our financial statements. We do not hedge against currency risk. 
<br><br>
The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy adopted by the PRC government. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Following the removal of the U.S. dollar peg, the Renminbi appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Since June 2010, the PRC government has allowed the Renminbi to appreciate slowly against the U.S. dollar again, and it has appreciated more than 10% since June 2010. In April 2012, the PRC government announced that it would allow greater Renminbi exchange rate fluctuation. However, it remains unclear how this announcement might be implemented. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in greater fluctuations of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future. 
<br><br>
To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would reduce the Renminbi amount we receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs, servicing our outstanding debts, or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would reduce the U.S. dollar amounts available to us. As of December 31, 2013, we had U.S. dollar-denominated debt outstanding of US$5.0 billion. If the U.S. dollar had appreciated/depreciated by 10% against the Renminbi, our interest payments as to these debt would have increased/decreased by RMB91 million (US$15 million) in the nine months ended December 31, 2013. 
<br><br>
As of December 31, 2013, we had Renminbi-denominated cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of RMB46,739 million and U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents of US$357 million. Assuming we had converted RMB46,739 million into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of RMB6.2164 for US$1.00 as of March 31, 2014, our total U.S. dollar cash balance would have been US$7,876 million. If the Renminbi had depreciated by 10% against the U.S. dollar, our U.S. dollar cash balance would have been US$7,192 million. 
<br><br>
Interest Rate Risk 
<br><br>
Our main interest rate exposure relates to bank borrowings. We also have interest-bearing assets, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and loan receivables. We manage our interest rate exposure with a focus on reducing our overall cost of debt and exposure to changes in interest rates. From time to time, we use derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, to manage our interest rate exposure. After taking into consideration the interest rate swaps that are entered into for hedging purposes, approximately 80% of the aggregate principal amount of our bank and other debt was at floating rates, and the remaining 20% was at fixed rates as of December 31, 2013. 
<br><br>
As of December 31, 2013, if interest rates increased/decreased by 1%, with all other variables having remained constant, and assuming the amount of bank borrowings outstanding at the end of the year was outstanding for the entire year, profit attributable to equity owners of our company would have been RMB408 million (US$66 million) higher/lower, respectively, mainly as a result of higher/lower interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and loan receivables. 
<br><br>
Market Price Risk 
<br><br>
We are exposed to market price risk primarily with respect to investment securities held by us which are reported at fair value. A substantial portion of our investment in equity investees represents unlisted equity securities which are all held for long-term appreciation or for strategic purposes and not subject to market price risk. We are not exposed to commodity price risk. 
<br><br>
The sensitivity analysis is determined based on the exposure of financial assets at fair value to market price risks related to equity and debt securities at the end of each reporting period. The securities we hold are accounted for as trading or available-for-sale based on our investment intent. Their changes in fair values are recorded as income for trading securities or through equity for available-for-sale securities, respectively. If market prices of the respective instruments held by us had been 1% higher/lower as of December 31, 2013, our investment securities would have been approximately RMB12 million (US$2 million) higher/lower, of which the majority of such amounts relating to trading securities will be recognized as income or loss during the respective period. 
<br><br>
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
<br><br>
Our significant accounting policies are set forth in note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount reported in consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are periodically re-evaluated by management and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. We have identified the following accounting policies as the most critical to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations, because the application of these policies requires significant and complex management estimates, assumptions and judgment, and the reporting of materially different amounts could result if different estimates or assumptions were used or different judgments were made. 
<br><br>
Recognition of Revenue 
<br><br>
Revenue principally represents marketing services revenue, commissions on transactions, membership and storefront fees and cloud computing revenue. Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of services in our ordinary course activities and is recorded net of VAT. Consistent with the criteria of ASC 605 “Revenue Recognition,” we recognize revenue when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been provided, (iii) the selling price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. 
<br><br>
The application of various accounting principles related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with non-standard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting treatment, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting. Other significant judgments include determining whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in a transaction and whether separate contracts are considered part of a single arrangement. 
<br><br>
For multiple element arrangements with customers, the arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to each element based on their relative fair values for revenue recognition purposes. The consideration is allocated to each element using vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the standalone selling price for each deliverable, or if neither type of evidence is available, using management’s best estimate of selling price. Significant judgment is required in assessing the fair values of these elements by considering standalone selling price and other observable data. Changes in the estimated fair values may cause the revenue recognized for each element to change but not the total amount of revenue allocated to a contract. We periodically re-assess the fair value of the elements as a result of changes in market conditions. For other arrangements, we apply significant judgment in determining whether we are acting as the principal or agent in a transaction, and whether separate contracts are treated as a single transaction, both of which could have significant implications on the amount of revenue recognized by us. 
<br><br>
Share-based Compensation Expense and Valuation of Our Ordinary Shares 
<br><br>
We account for various types of share-based awards granted to our directors, employees, consultants and other grantees, including certain employees of our related companies, such as Alipay and affiliates such as China Smart Logistics, who perform services for us, in accordance with the authoritative guidance on share-based compensation expense. Under the fair value recognition provision of such guidance, compensation for share-based awards granted, including share options, restricted shares and RSUs, is measured at the grant date, or at future vesting date in the case of consultants or other grantees, based on the fair value of the awards and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award, on an accelerated attribution method. Therefore, in the case of share-based awards to non-employees, the fair value of the unvested portion is re-measured each period, with the resulting difference, if any, recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered. Under the accelerated attribution method, each vesting installment of a graded vesting award is treated as a separate share-based award, accordingly each vesting installment is separately measured and attributed to expense, resulting in accelerated recognition of share-based compensation expense. 
<br><br>
Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated income statement and as such is recorded for only those share-based awards that we expect to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any. We revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates. 
<br><br>
Determining the fair value of share-based awards requires significant judgment. We estimated the fair value of our share options using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model, which requires inputs such as the fair value of our ordinary shares, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, expected life and expected volatility on the following assumptions: 

 <br><br>

--Fair value of our ordinary shares C as our ordinary shares are not publicly traded, the fair value was based on management estimates, as discussed in the paragraphs below.  

 <br><br>

--Risk free interest rate C the risk free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected life of the share options.  
<br><br>
 

--Expected dividend yield C we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.  

 <br><br>

--Expected life C the expected term was estimated based on the average between the vesting period and the contractual term.  

 
<br><br>
--Expected volatility C as we do not have a trading history for our ordinary shares, the expected volatility for our ordinary shares was estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers based on the price fluctuations of their shares over a period equivalent to the expected term of the share options granted. Industry peers consist of several public companies in the technology industry similar in size, which are engaged in similar business sectors in China and worldwide. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount  of historical information regarding the volatility of our own ordinary share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. 
 <br><br>

The following table presents the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted during the periods presented: <br><br>
<a href= "pic63.html">fair value of options</a><br><br>
If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model changes significantly, share-based compensation expense for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously. <br><br>

The administrators of our share incentive plans, comprising two of our executive officers, have the discretion to determine the fair value of our ordinary shares. Such plans require that all options granted be exercisable at a price not less than the fair value of our ordinary shares on the date of grant. In the absence of a public trading market, the determination of the fair value of our ordinary shares by the administrators was made with reference to the price at which we had recently sold our ordinary shares to third party investors, or other representative private share sale transactions entered into on an arms-length basis known to us. If such references were not available, the valuations of our ordinary shares were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Practice Aid, Valuation of PrivatelyCHeld Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, and with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm from time to time. The assumptions we use in the valuation model are based on future expectations combined with management judgment, with inputs of numerous objective and subjective factors, to determine the fair value of our ordinary shares, including the following factors: <br><br>

 

--our operating and financial performance;  
<br><br>
 

--current business conditions and projections;  
<br><br>
 

--our stage of development;  

 <br><br>

--the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preference shares relative to our ordinary shares;  

 <br><br>

--the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the ordinary shares underlying these share-based awards, such as an initial public offering;  

 <br><br>

--any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for our ordinary shares; and  

 <br><br>

--the market performance of industry peers.  
<br><br>
In order to determine the fair value of our ordinary shares underlying each share-based award grant, we first determined our business enterprise value, or BEV, and then allocated the BEV to each element of our capital structure (convertible preference shares and ordinary shares) using the option pricing model. Up until the contemporaneous valuation report as of January 15, 2014, our BEV was estimated using a combination of two generally accepted approaches: the market approach using the guideline company method, or GCM, and the income approach using the discounted cash flow method, or DCF. The market approach considers valuation metrics based on trading multiples of a selected industry peer group of companies. Three multiples, adjusted for different growth rates, profit margins, tax rates and risk levels, are calculated for the guideline companies, namely (i) enterprise value to sales; (ii) enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization; and (iii) enterprise value to earnings before interest and tax. The median price multiples for the first forecasted year of the guideline companies are applied to our respective valuation metrics to derive our enterprise value. The DCF method estimates enterprise value based on the estimated present value of future net cash flows that the business is expected to generate over a forecasted period and an estimate of the present value of cash flows beyond that period, which is referred to as terminal value. The estimated present value is calculated using a discount rate based on the guideline companies’ weighted average cost of capital, which accounts for the time value of money and the appropriate degree of risks inherent in the business. Discount rates of 14.5%, 13.0%, 13.5% and 11.5% were used in connection with our DCF analysis included in our contemporaneous valuation reports issued by an independent appraisal firm on April 30, 2013, October 10, 2013, January 15, 2014 and April 16, 2014, respectively. Significant management judgment is involved in determining the projected cash flows and the discount rates, which reflect the risks of our business and other variables. The GCM and DCF methods are then weighted equally in determining our BEV. In addition, a marketability discount, taking into consideration the plans for and status of our proposed initial public offering, of 12.0%, 10.0%, 10.0% and 5.0% was applied to arrive at the BEV as of April 30, 2013, October 10, 2013, January 15, 2014 and April 16, 2014, respectively. 
<br><br>
In addition to the GCM and DCF methods, for the contemporaneous valuation report as of April 16, 2014, the market transaction method, or MTM, was also adopted. MTM considers recent transactions of secondary shares by our existing shareholders, which indicate the equity value of the underlying business being evaluated. We assigned a 50% weighting to MTM and the remaining 50% weighting equally to GCM and DCF. We assigned a higher weighting on MTM due to the higher volume of third-party private transactions that took place or were expected to take place in April 2014. 
<br><br>

We granted share-based awards between April 1, 2011 and the date of this prospectus at these fair values:

During the same period, we also had the following transactions for the subscription of restricted shares and subscription of rights to acquire restricted shares at these fair values: <br><br>

Subscription of rights to acquire our restricted shares. In July 2013, we offered selected partners of the Alibaba Partnership subscription rights to acquire our restricted shares. These rights are not subject to any vesting conditions and entitle the holders to purchase restricted shares at a price of US$14.50 per share during a four year period. Upon the exercise of such rights, the underlying ordinary shares may not be transferred for a period of eight years from the date of subscription of the relevant rights. The fair value of the rights was determined by the Black-Scholes option-valuation model and was paid in full in cash by the subscribers. Therefore, no compensation expense was recorded for these rights. A discount for post-vesting sales restriction of 38% was applied to arrive at the estimated value of the restricted shares for the determination of the fair value of the rights. <br><br>

The following table sets forth the fair value of our ordinary shares estimated at different times for the purpose of the accounting of our share-based awards based on representative transactions among our shareholders, our issuance of ordinary shares to third-party investors, contemporaneous valuation reports from an independent appraisal firm and the other factors described above: <br><br>

<a href= "pic66.html">fair value of our ordinary shares </a><br><br>
We believe the growth of the fair value of our ordinary shares since the second calendar quarter of 2011 was primarily due to the organic growth of our business and the continuous improvement in our financial performance as a whole. 
<br><br>
The determined fair value of our ordinary shares increased from US$8.00 per share in the second calendar quarter of 2011 to US$13.50 per share in the fourth calendar quarter of 2011. Valuation during the fourth calendar quarter of 2011 was determined with reference to a liquidity program offered by institutional investors to our employees and other shareholders of a total consideration of US$2.0 billion (RMB12.4 billion). 
<br><br>
Fair value of our ordinary shares was further increased from US$13.50 per share in the fourth calendar quarter of 2011 to US$15.50 in the third calendar quarter of 2012 based on the issuance of ordinary shares to third-party investors of a total consideration of US$2.6 billion (RMB16.2 billion). 
<br><br>
Since then, the change in fair value was determined by management with reference to contemporaneous valuation reports at various times. Fair value of our ordinary shares increased from US$15.50 in the third calendar quarter of 2012 to US$18.50 in the second calendar quarter of 2013. We believe the change was primarily attributable to an updated business outlook based on a review of our actual financial performance at the time. 
<br><br>
Fair value of our ordinary shares increased from US$18.50 in the second calendar quarter of 2013 to US$22.00 in the third calendar quarter of 2013. We believe the change was primarily attributable to the increase in valuation metrics of our industry peer group of companies during the period. 
<br><br>
Fair value of our ordinary shares increased from US$22.00 in the third calendar quarter of 2013 to US$25.00 in the fourth calendar quarter of 2013. We believe the change was primarily attributable to an updated business outlook based on a review of our actual financial performance, as well as decreases in both the discount rate and marketability discount during this period. 
<br><br>
Fair value of our ordinary shares increased from US$25.00 in the fourth quarter of 2013 to US$32.00 in mid-January 2014. We believe the change was primarily attributable to an updated business outlook based on a review of our actual financial performance and an increase in the valuation metrics of our industry peer group of companies. 
<br><br>
Subsequently in March and April 2014, the fair value of our ordinary shares increased further to US$40.00 and US$50.00, respectively. We believe the increases were primarily attributable to our stated intention to conduct an initial public offering in the United States, which led to decreases in both the discount rate and marketability discount during that period. In addition, the increased volume and price of our ordinary shares with respect to secondary transactions provided reference to fair value. 
<br><br>
Based upon an assumed initial public offering price of US$             per share (the mid-point of the range shown on the cover page of this prospectus), the aggregate intrinsic value of our share-based awards outstanding as of December 31, 2013 was approximately US$             million, of which approximately US$             million related to vested share-based awards and approximately US$             million related to unvested share-based awards. 
<br><br>
As of December 31, 2013, the total unamortized share-based compensation expense related to our ordinary shares that we expect to recognize was RMB2,810 million (US$452 million) with a weighted-average remaining requisite service period of 1.9 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have anticipated, share-based compensation expense related to these awards will be different from our expectations. Furthermore, share-based compensation expense will be affected by changes in the fair value of our shares, as certain share-based awards were granted to non-employees where the unvested portions of the awards are remeasured at each reporting date through the vesting dates in the future. As of December 31, 2013, share-based awards granted to non-employees included 693,785 share options and 6,888,779 restricted shares and RSUs. 
<br><br>
Alibaba.com Limited, a consolidated subsidiary that was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange from November 2007 to September 2012, also issued various types of share-based awards to its employees prior to its privatization and delisting. Share-based compensation expense underlying those subsidiary awards was insignificant. 
<br><br>
Equity-settled Donation Expense 
<br><br>
In October 2013, we granted options to acquire 50,000,000 of our ordinary shares to a non-profit organization designated by Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, subject to irrevocable instructions to designate and transfer these share options to the separate charitable trusts to be established by Jack and Joe. These share options were approved by our board of directors and the options are not subject to any vesting condition and are exercisable for a period of four years starting from the grant date. The exercise price of these options is US$25.00 per share based on a fair market value appraisal process. For each of the eight years beginning one year after the date of listing of our ordinary shares on a recognized stock exchange, the charitable trusts are permitted to sell only up to 6,250,000 ordinary shares (or one-eight of the total number of ordinary shares subject to the options) per year excluding such number of unsold ordinary shares carried forward from previous years. The fair value of the share options was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which requires inputs such as the fair value of the underlying restricted shares, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, expected life and expected volatility. As we do not have a history of granting such options for charity purposes, the expected life was estimated to be the exercisable period of the options. To determine the fair value of the restricted shares, discounts for post-vesting sales restrictions from 18% to 38% were applied to the fair value of our ordinary shares depending on the duration of the restriction period of each particular tranche. We have determined the fair value of these options based on the methodology described above, with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm. As there are no vesting conditions attached to the above share options, equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 million (US$204 million) was recognized in full and recorded in general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended December 31, 2013. 
<br><br>
The considerations, assumptions and valuations of ordinary shares as well as assumptions for risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield and expected volatility used to calculate the equity-based donation expense are the same as those used in connection with our share-based awards during the corresponding period. See “―Share-based Compensation Expense and Valuation of Our Ordinary Shares.” 
<br><br>
Recognition of Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets/Liabilities 
<br><br>
We are mainly subject to income tax in China, but are also subject to taxation on profit arising in or derived from the tax jurisdiction where our subsidiaries are domiciled and operate outside China. Income taxes are assessed and determined on an entity basis. There are transactions (including entitlement to preferential tax treatment and deductibility of expenses) where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain until the final tax position is confirmed by relevant tax authorities. In addition, we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes could be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. 
<br><br>
Deferred income tax is recognized for all temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available in the future against which the temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses could be utilized. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method. The deferred tax assets recognized are mainly related to the temporary differences arising from accrued expenses which are not deductible until paid under the applicable PRC tax laws. We have also recognized deferred tax liabilities on the undistributed earnings generated by our subsidiaries in China, which are subject to withholding taxes when they are remitted offshore to us. As of December 31, 2013, the amounts accrued in deferred tax liabilities relating to such withholding tax on dividends were determined on the basis that 100% of the distributable reserves of the major subsidiaries operating in China will not be indefinitely reinvested in China. A change in our judgment as to whether we will reinvest the profits in China indefinitely will impact the deferred tax liabilities to be provided in the future. 
<br><br>
Fair Value Determination Related to the Accounting for Business Combinations 
<br><br>
A component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and integrate complementary businesses into our ecosystem. We complete business combinations from time to time which require us to perform purchase price allocations. In order to recognize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, mainly consisting of intangible assets and goodwill, as well as the fair value of any contingent consideration to be recognized, we use valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and ratio analysis in comparison to comparable companies in similar industries under the income approach, market approach and cost approach. Major factors considered include historical financial results and assumptions including future growth rates, an estimate of weighted average cost of capital and the effect of expected changes in regulation. Most of the valuations of our acquired businesses have been performed by valuation specialists under our management’s supervision. We believe that the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that market participants would use. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates. 
<br><br>
Fair Value Determination Related to Financial Instruments Accounted for at Fair Value 
<br><br>
We have a significant amount of investments and liabilities that are classified as Level 2 and Level 3 according to ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures.” The valuations for the investments classified as Level 2 relating to financial derivatives and interest rate swaps are provided by independent third parties such as the custodian banks. The valuation for the liabilities classified as Level 3 relating to contingent consideration and put liability in relation to investments and acquisitions are determined based on unobservable inputs, such as historical financial results and assumptions about future growth rates, which require significant judgment to determine the future outcome of such contingencies. 
<br><br>
Impairment Assessment on Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
<br><br>
We test annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets exceeds the recoverable amounts, whether goodwill and intangible assets have suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. For the impairment assessment on goodwill, we have elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the two-step impairment testing of goodwill is necessary. In this assessment, we consider primary factors such as industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations. Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is performed. 
<br><br>
For the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment, we identify the reporting units and compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill. For intangible assets, we perform an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. These assessments primarily use cash flow projections based on financial forecasts prepared by management and an estimated terminal value. The expected growth in revenues and operating margin, timing of future capital expenditures, an estimate of weighted average cost of capital and terminal growth rate are based on actual and prior year performance and market development expectations. The periods of the financial forecasts generally range from three to five years. Judgment is required to determine key assumptions adopted in the cash flow projections and changes to key assumptions can significantly affect these cash flow projections and the results of the impairment tests. 
<br><br>
Impairment of Investments in Equity Investees 
<br><br>
We continually review our investments in equity investees to determine whether a decline in fair value below the carrying value is other than temporary. Factors that we consider include the length of time that the fair value of the investment is below our carrying value; the financial condition, operating performance and the prospects of the equity investee; and other company specific information such as recent financing rounds completed by these equity investees. Judgment is required to determine the weighting and impact of the aforementioned factors and changes to such determination can significantly affect the results of the impairment tests. 
<br><br>
Depreciation and Amortization 
<br><br>
The costs of property and equipment and intangible assets are charged ratably as depreciation and amortization expenses, respectively, over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets using the straight-line method. We periodically review changes in technology and industry conditions, asset retirement activity and residual values to determine adjustments to estimated remaining useful lives and depreciation and amortization rates. Actual economic lives may differ from estimated useful lives. Periodic reviews could result in a change in estimated useful lives and therefore depreciation and amortization expenses in future periods. 
<br><br>
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Relating to Micro Loans 
<br><br>
We record allowances for doubtful accounts on the micro loans according to our best estimate of the losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of loans. The loan periods extended by us to merchants generally range from 7 days to 360 days. We estimate the allowances by multiplying pre-determined percentages to the outstanding loan amounts based on the aging of the loans. Given that substantially all borrowers are merchants on our marketplaces, we are able to monitor the transaction history of these merchants and other operating data accumulated on our platforms, and assess the general financial health of these borrowers. Judgment is required to determine the percentages used to determine the allowance amounts and whether such amounts are adequate to cover potential bad debts, and periodic reviews are performed to ensure such percentages continue to reflect our best estimate of the inherent losses based on our assessment of the merchants’ ability to repay the loans. 
<br><br>
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
<br><br>
In July 2012, the FASB issued revised guidance on “Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.” The revised guidance provides an entity the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform a quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The revised guidance is effective for our impairment tests performed for fiscal year 2014. This amendment will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
<br><br>
In February 2013, the FASB issued revised guidance on “Comprehensive Income: Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” The revised guidance does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. However, the revised guidance requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. The revised guidance was early adopted by us beginning in fiscal year 2012. The revised guidance does not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
<br><br>
In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, “Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists,” which provides that a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit would be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward if such settlement is required or expected in the event the uncertain tax position is disallowed. The new guidance is effective prospectively for us for fiscal year 2014. The revised guidance will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Company Overview 
<br><br>
We are the largest online and mobile commerce company in the world in terms of gross merchandise volume in 2013, according to industry sources. We operate our ecosystem as a platform for third parties, and we do not engage in direct sales, compete with our merchants or hold inventory. <br><br>
We operate Taobao Marketplace, China’s largest online shopping destination, Tmall, China’s largest third-party platform for brands and retailers, in each case in terms of gross merchandise volume, and Juhuasuan, China’s most popular group buying marketplace by its monthly active users, in each case in 2013 according to iResearch. These three marketplaces, which comprise our China retail marketplaces, generated a combined GMV of RMB1,542 billion (US$248 billion) from 231 million active buyers and 8 million active sellers in the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. A significant portion of our customers have begun transacting on our mobile platform, and we are focused on capturing this opportunity. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, mobile GMV accounted for 19.7% of our GMV, up from 7.4% in the same period in the previous year. <br><br>

In addition to our three China retail marketplaces, we operate Alibaba.com, China’s largest global online wholesale marketplace in 2013 by revenue, according to iResearch, 1688.com, our China wholesale marketplace, and AliExpress, our global consumer marketplace, as well as provide cloud computing services. 
<br><br>
We provide the fundamental technology infrastructure and marketing reach to help businesses leverage the power of the Internet to establish an online presence and conduct commerce with consumers and businesses. We have been a leader in developing online marketplace standards in China, including consumer protection programs, marketplace rules, qualification standards for merchants and buyer and seller rating systems. Given the scale we have been able to achieve, an ecosystem has developed around our platform that consists of buyers, sellers, third-party service providers, strategic alliance partners, and investee companies. Our platform and the role we play in connecting buyers and sellers and making it possible for them to do business anytime and anywhere is at the nexus of this ecosystem. Much of our effort, our time and our energy is spent on initiatives that are for the greater good of the ecosystem and the various participants in it. We feel a strong responsibility for the continued development of the ecosystem and we take ownership for this development. Accordingly, we refer to this as “our ecosystem.” <br><br>

Our ecosystem has strong self-reinforcing network effects that benefit our marketplace participants, who are invested in our ecosystem’s growth and success. Through this ecosystem, we have transformed how commerce is conducted in China and built a reputation as a trusted partner for the participants in our ecosystem. For more discussion of our ecosystem, see “― Our Ecosystem and Its Participants.” <br><br>

We have made significant investments in proprietary technologies and infrastructure in order to support our growing ecosystem. Our technology and infrastructure allow us to harness the substantial volume of data generated from our marketplaces and to further develop and optimize the products and services offered on our platform. 
<br><br>
Through our related company, Alipay, we offer payment and escrow services for buyers and sellers, providing security, trust and convenience to our users.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T21">Our Market Opportunity </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Our market opportunity is primarily driven by the following factors: 
<br><br>
 

--Our business benefits from the rising spending power of Chinese consumers. China’s real consumption in 2013 was 36.5% of total GDP, which is a rate that is significantly lower than that of other countries, such as the United States, which had a consumption penetration rate of 66.8% in 2013, according to Euromonitor International. We believe that growth in consumption will drive higher levels of online and mobile commerce.  
<br><br>
 

--China’s online shopping population is relatively underpenetrated. According to CNNIC, China had the world’s largest Internet population with 618 million users as of December 31, 2013. According to CNNIC, China had 302 million online shoppers in 2013. We believe that the number of online shoppers will increase, driven by continued growth in Internet users as well as by the higher percentage of Internet users making purchases online.  

 <br><br>

--We believe that consumers are expanding the categories of products and services they are purchasing online, which will further increase online and mobile commerce activity.  

 <br><br>

--We believe that the increased usage of mobile devices will make access to the Internet even more convenient, drive higher online shopper engagement and enable new applications. China has the world’s largest mobile Internet user base with 500 million users as of December 31, 2013, according to CNNIC, and mobile usage is expected to increase, driven by the growing adoption of mobile devices.  

 <br><br>

--China’s offline retail market faces significant challenges due to few nationwide brick and mortar retailers, an underdeveloped physical retail infrastructure, limited product selection and inconsistent product quality. These challenges in China’s retail infrastructure, which we believe are particularly acute outside of tier 1 and 2 cities, are causing consumers to leapfrog the offline retail market in favor of online and mobile commerce.  

 <br><br>

--China has an increasingly extensive and rapidly improving logistics infrastructure consisting of nationwide, regional and local delivery services. We believe that the rapid development of China’s distributed logistics infrastructure and nationwide express delivery networks has been driven in part by the growth of e-commerce and will continue to support the unique demands of consumers and merchants conducting e-commerce transactions on marketplaces.  
<br><br>
Overall, online shopping, which represented 7.9% of the total China consumption in 2013, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 27.2% from 2013 to 2016, according to iResearch, as more consumers shop online and e-commerce spending per consumer increases. 
<br><br>
Growth in China Consumption. China’s real GDP of RMB58.0 trillion (US$9.3 trillion) in 2013 is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.4% from 2013 to 2016, according to Euromonitor International. Real consumption in China is projected to experience a higher rate of growth at a CAGR of 8.6% during the same period, according to Euromonitor International, thus becoming an increasingly important contributor to the Chinese economy. The proportion of GDP accounted for by consumption in China was 36.5% in 2013, a level which was significantly lower than the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany, according to Euromonitor International. 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic70.html">Growth in China Consumption</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic71.html">Consumption as % of GDP </a><br><br>
The rising real income level of Chinese consumers has been a major driving force behind the increasing contribution of consumption to the overall economy. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the real annual per capita income of rural households and urban households in China increased by CAGRs of 10.2% and 8.5% between 2008 and 2013, respectively. In addition, the household savings rate in China declined from 40.4% in 2009 to 39.5% in 2013, according to Euromonitor International. We believe the declining trend in savings rate reflects consumers’ increasing propensity to spend on discretionary items, including higher quality products and services. As Chinese consumers continue to experience real wage increases, as well as a higher propensity to spend, we expect that the contribution of consumption to overall GDP in China will continue to increase over time and that the growth rate of consumption will continue to outpace GDP growth. <br><br>

Growth in China Internet Population and Penetration. Internet penetration in China is expanding rapidly. Internet users in China grew from 298 million, or 22.6% of China’s total population, as of the end of 2008 to 618 million, or 45.8% of the total population, as of the end of 2013, according to CNNIC. However, Internet penetration in China is still relatively low when compared to that of many other countries. According to iResearch, China’s Internet population is projected to grow to 790 million by the end of 2016. <br><br>

<a href= "pic72.html">China Internet Population </a><br><br>
<a href= "pic73.html">China Internet Penetration</a><br><br>
The percentage of Internet users buying products and services online in China is lower than that in many other countries. According to CNNIC, there were 302 million Internet shoppers in China in 2013, representing 48.9% of total Internet users, compared to 74.2% in the United States in the same year, according to IDC. 

<br><br>
Greater Penetration of Online Shopping Across Consumption Categories. The current product mix in China consumption offers opportunities for increased online shopping in underpenetrated categories. We expect that online shoppers will expand their shopping activities into other consumption categories and that the average online spending per user will increase. The consumption categories that we expect to account for increasing online sales include food and beverages, health goods and medical services as well as recreation and culture. According to an estimate by Euromonitor International, China’s consumption expenditures in 2013 for food and non-alcoholic beverages, health goods and medical services and recreation and culture were RMB5,520 billion (US$888 billion), RMB1,397 billion (US$225 billion) and RMB443 billion (US$71 billion), respectively. <br><br>

<a href= "pic74.html">Online shopping penetration comparison</a><br><br>

<a href= "pic75.html">Breakdown of consumption in China </a><br><br>


Growth in Mobile Usage. Despite China’s relatively low Internet penetration rate, China’s mobile Internet user base reached 500 million as of December 31, 2013, according to CNNIC. Smartphone shipments in China reached 351 million in 2013 and will exceed 428 million in 2014, according to projections by IDC. We believe this growth in mobile users will make access to the Internet even more convenient and will accelerate the adoption of e-commerce. Increased mobile Internet access through mobile devices will allow Internet users to shop anytime, anywhere. 
<br><br>
Challenges in China’s Offline Retail Market Provide Online Retail Opportunity. China’s retail industry is highly fragmented. As of December 31, 2012, there were 127 cities in China with populations greater than 1 million, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. According to Euromonitor International, the top 20 retailers in China had a combined market share of approximately 11.5% in 2013, as compared with approximately 39.8% in the United States in the same period. <br><br>

In 2013, per capita retail space in China was 0.6 square meters, which was significantly lower than that in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany, according to Euromonitor International. 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic76.html">Offline retail infrastructure </a><br><br>
The less developed physical retail infrastructure and distribution system in China is especially apparent in smaller cities and towns where we believe China’s national retailing leaders have an even more limited presence. However, a substantial portion of China’s retail sales is attributable to these regions. As seen in the table below, approximately 60% of retail sales in 2012 was attributable to regions outside of tier 1 and 2 cities, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. In addition to the 35 tier 1 and tier 2 cities that have populations of over 1 million each, there are 92 other cities with populations greater than one million as of December 31, 2012, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. In these smaller cities and towns, consumers are generally served by local merchants and stores, and as a result, product selection may be limited. In addition, quality and safety are major consumer concerns in China across a wide variety of categories, from food, household products to clothing, which has the effect of constraining consumption. 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic77.html">Macro indicators of tier 1 and tier 2 cities and other regions in China </a><br><br>
Consumers Leapfrogging to Online and Mobile Commerce Due to Underdeveloped Offline Retail Infrastructure. The challenges of an under developed physical retail infrastructure, together with the expected growth of retail sales in China, present a significant opportunity for e-commerce. We believe that as traditional brick and mortar retailers face challenges in reaching Chinese consumers, consumers will increasingly seek online channels to meet their needs and the availability of online shopping will stimulate higher consumption than otherwise would have been the case. In particular, we believe that in regions outside tier 1 and 2 cities, purchases through e-commerce channels could contribute to incremental increases in consumption in China due to the variety of product offerings available through online marketplaces, creating additional demand from local consumers. 
<br><br>
Offline Retailers Use Online Marketplaces to Grow Their Business. We believe that the leading brick and mortar retailers are motivated to establish an online presence through an online platform in addition to their own e-commerce websites because of the consumer reach and brand building opportunity that a leading online platform such as Tmall can offer.
<br><br>
China’s Expanding Logistics Infrastructure Facilitates E-commerce. China has an increasingly extensive and rapidly improving logistics infrastructure, consisting of nationwide, regional and local delivery services. We believe that the rapid development of China’s distributed logistics infrastructure and nationwide express delivery networks has been driven by the growth of e-commerce and will continue to support the unique demands of consumers and merchants engaging in e-commerce transactions on marketplaces. According to data provided as of March 2014 by our 14 strategic delivery partners we work with, they employed over 950,000 delivery personnel in more than 600 cities and 31 provinces, directly controlled municipalities and autonomous regions in China. Collectively, they operated more than 1,700 distribution centers and more than 100,000 delivery stations. This network managed the delivery of 5.0 billion packages from our China retail marketplaces to consumers in 2013. We believe orders from transactions generated on our marketplaces represented a significant portion of our logistics partners’ total delivery volumes in 2013 and, accordingly, the data of our major logistics partners provide a representative picture of the scope of logistics capabilities in China today. 
<br><br>
As a result of these factors, we expect more consumers to shop online and increase the breadth of their purchases across multiple categories. In addition, certain factors that have traditionally limited the growth of online shopping in China, including the quality and coverage of the logistics network and the convenience and availability of online payment services, are no longer limiting factors. According to iResearch, China’s online shopping is expected to increase from RMB1,841 billion (US$296 billion) in 2013 to RMB3,790 billion (US$610 billion) in 2016 at a CAGR of 27.2%. China’s online shopping penetration rate, defined as online shopping market size as a percentage of total consumption, is also expected to increase from 7.9% in 2013 to 11.5% at the end of 2016, according to iResearch.

	<b><a name="T23">Our Strengths</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We believe that the following strengths contribute to our success and are differentiating factors that set us apart from our peers. <br><br>

Management Team with Owner Mentality and Proven Track Record 
<br><br>
Our management team’s clear sense of mission, long-term focus and commitment to the values that define the Alibaba culture have been central to our successful track record. Our management team has been remarkably stable and has created and grown leading businesses organically, including Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, Alibaba.com, Alibaba Cloud Computing and our related company Alipay. We built early leadership in mobile commerce through self-developed mobile app products, including the Mobile Taobao App and Alipay mobile payment applications. Our management team is organized as a partnership and we believe this partnership culture, as well as substantial long-term equity ownership, encourage our business leaders to think like owners rather than agents. Our management team acts with a keen sense of responsibility for the success of our customers, employees and shareholders. 
<br><br>
Trusted Brands 
<br><br>
Alibaba, Taobao, Tmall and Alipay are well recognized and trusted brands in China. Due to the strength of these brands, a majority of our customers navigate directly to our China retail marketplaces to find the products and services they are seeking instead of via third-party search engines. Our brands represent superior product selection, convenience and trust. As a company, we believe consumers perceive us to be a leader in the Internet industry, which engenders trust in our products and services. Through our China retail marketplaces and associated mobile apps, our products and services have become a part of people’s daily lives in China. 
<br><br>
Thriving Ecosystem with Powerful Network Effects 
<br><br>
We do not just operate a company; we view ourselves as the steward of a thriving ecosystem with responsibility for developing and balancing the ecosystem for the benefit of all participants. This provides us with the following key advantages: <br><br>

 

--The participants in our ecosystem are invested in its success and growth. These participants, including buyers, sellers, brands, producers, marketing affiliates, logistics providers, retail operating partners, developers and other service providers, all derive significant economic value from the continued success of the ecosystem. We believe our ecosystem drives the livelihood of many of the sellers and third-party service providers, and as a result the interests of these participants are aligned with ours to ensure the continued success of our ecosystem.  
<br><br>
 

--The interactions among these participants create value for one another as our ecosystem expands and generates strong network effects. More merchants on our marketplaces increase the choices available to consumers, and more consumers on our marketplaces increase the potential sales for merchants through a self-reinforcing, mutually beneficial network effect. In addition, services offered by other participants in our ecosystem enhance the user experience on our platform. These network effects increase the loyalty and frequency of use of our marketplaces by buyers and make it difficult to replicate our ecosystem.  

 <br><br>

--Our Taobao Marketplace is central to the ecosystem as it is a shopping destination for over 100 million visitors every day. These visitors could be tapped as potential buyers for many of our marketplaces and services, including those we currently offer and those that we expect to develop. For example, Tmall and Juhuasuan source a significant amount of buyer traffic from Taobao Marketplace, thereby significantly reducing their customer acquisition costs.  

 <br><br>

--The scope of our ecosystem and the network effects it creates also significantly reduce our reliance on a sales force for our marketing services. The sellers on our marketplaces are also our online marketing customers, and accordingly are drawn to purchase services from us without significant sales or marketing efforts on our part. For example, Alimama accesses the large Taobao Marketplace merchant base as customers for online marketing services without the need to rely on a field sales team.  
<br><br>
Mobile Leadership 
<br><br>
We are the leader in mobile commerce in China in terms of mobile retail GMV. Mobile transactions represented 19.7% of our total GMV in the three months ended December 31, 2013. According to iResearch, 
<br><br>
 

--mobile GMV transacted on our China retail marketplaces accounted for 76.2% of total mobile retail GMV (excluding virtual items) in China in the twelve months ended December 31, 2013;  

 <br><br>

--our Mobile Taobao App has been the most popular mobile commerce app in China by mobile MAUs every month since August 2012;  
<br><br>
 

--the mobile payment application developed by Alipay that powers payments on our apps as well as on third-party mobile commerce apps has been China’s leading mobile payment application by mobile MAUs since August 2012; and  

 <br><br>

--the Mobile Taobao App, Alipay and the UCWeb mobile browser were three of the top five mobile apps in China based on mobile MAUs in February 2014 (the most recently available month).  
<br><br>
Our mobile apps are top-of-mind commerce apps among Chinese consumers and we believe that our leading market position in mobile commerce reflects the strong brands of our China retail marketplaces. As with users visiting our web-based marketplaces, users of our mobile apps have strong commercial intent, generally resulting in significant conversion into sales for merchants. Because of the strong commercial intent of users visiting our marketplaces, we believe that we are well-positioned to monetize our mobile user base in the future. 
<br><br>
Scalable Logistics Platform 
<br><br>
We offer sellers on our marketplaces the benefits of a distributed and scalable logistics platform and information system to provide high quality delivery services to sellers and buyers on a large scale. In 2013, we facilitated the delivery of 5.0 billion packages generated from transactions on our China retail marketplaces, a number of packages that represented 54% of the 9.2 billion packages that, according to the State Post Bureau of the PRC, were delivered by delivery companies in China meeting certain minimum revenue thresholds. The scalability of this network was demonstrated by its success in handling of 156 million packages generated on our Singles Day promotion in 2013 compared to a daily average of 13.7 million packages generated from transactions on our China retail marketplaces in 2013. 
<br><br>
We have established a network of logistics providers who are linked to us through our proprietary logistics information system, which is operated by China Smart Logistics. This logistics information system allows all participants to share information on order specifics, delivery status and user feedback and enables us to provide a higher quality experience to both sellers and buyers. 
<br><br>
Our platform approach helps to address the requirements of facilitating the delivery of packages across a wide range of product categories from millions of sellers to hundreds of millions of buyers in dispersed locations across China. We do not directly own the physical infrastructure or employ delivery personnel. Instead, we work with multiple logistics providers to achieve flexible, scalable and responsive service and cost effectiveness for both sellers and buyers. Because we do not operate our own logistics network and because of our scale, the logistics companies we work with view us as a key partner rather than as a competitor. 
<br><br>
Reliable, Scalable and Cost-effective Proprietary Technology 
<br><br>
The substantial volume of transactions and data generated on our marketplaces and interactions among participants in our ecosystem necessitates a reliable, scalable and cost-effective technology infrastructure. We have made significant investments in our infrastructure and data technology to support the strong growth in our business. We have developed proprietary technology such as our distributed relational database, general purpose computing clusters, content delivery networks, data management platform and personalized product search engines. The development of proprietary technology has minimized our reliance on third-party commercial hardware and software, reduced our operating costs and given us the flexibility to innovate and rapidly scale our business. The reliability and scalability of our technology infrastructure is evidenced, for example, by our successful processing of 254 million orders within 24 hours during our Singles Day promotion on November 11, 2013. In addition, due to the volume of transactions, the “always-on” nature of our marketplaces and the stringent security demands of commerce and payment transactions, we are able to attract world-class talent looking to solve difficult, complex and large-scale engineering challenges. 
<br><br>
Data Insights <br><br>
Data from consumer behavior and transactions completed on our marketplaces and interactions among participants in our ecosystem provide us with valuable insights to help us and our sellers improve the buyer experience, operate more efficiently and create innovative products and services. For example, we provide data to sellers on a real-time basis to enable them to better understand industry trends in the sectors in which they operate, as well as to help them target and acquire customers. Through our data management platform, or DMP, we work with brands and merchants to enhance understanding of their customer data and to direct targeted marketing to a broader base of consumers with similar attributes. For buyers, we use our data to create a better shopping experience by personalizing search results and shopping recommendations. We also leverage our data to help our logistics partners improve their fulfillment and delivery systems, processes and resource allocation. 
<br><br>
Our Third-party Platform Business Model 
<br><br>
Our business model is to connect buyers and sellers and enable them to do business. Unlike many e-commerce companies, we do not sell directly to customers and we do not compete against the merchants on our marketplaces or against various service providers, logistics companies or other participants of our ecosystem. Our exclusively third-party platform business model allows us to scale rapidly without the risks and capital requirements of sourcing, merchandising and holding inventory borne by direct sale companies. This business model drives our profitability and strong cash flow, which give us the flexibility to further improve our platform, expand our ecosystem and aggressively invest in people, technology, innovative products and strategically important assets.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T24">Our Strategies </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The key elements of our strategy to grow our business include: 
<br><br>
Increase Active Buyers and Wallet Share 
<br><br>
There were 231 million active buyers on our China retail marketplaces in 2013. In 2013, the average active buyer on our China retail marketplaces placed 49 orders, up from 39 orders in 2012 and 33 orders in 2011. We will continue to develop and market the value proposition of our retail marketplaces to attract new buyers as well as increase the wallet share of existing buyers through more frequent buying and buying across more product categories. We intend to achieve growth through customer loyalty programs, high quality customer service, marketing and promotional campaigns, and expansion of marketing affiliates, as well as by promoting the usage of our various mobile commerce apps such as our Mobile Taobao App. 
<br><br>
Expand Categories and Offerings 
<br><br>
In 2013, the average active buyer on our China retail marketplaces placed orders in 9.8 of our 115 product categories, compared to 8.7 product categories in 2012 and 7.5 product categories in 2011. We believe that growth in the number of product and service categories and products and services purchased within each category contributes to higher average spending per customer and therefore increases GMV. We aim to enhance the shopping experience for consumers, increase consumer engagement and create additional opportunities for merchants by developing and promoting additional categories and offerings. For example, we have recently taken initiatives to launch or expand offerings in specialty categories such as groceries, digital entertainment and local services. We will continue to explore ways to improve consumer satisfaction on our marketplaces so that consumers will buy across more product categories. We intend to complement organic product category expansion with strategic alliances, investments and acquisitions. 
<br><br>
Extend Our Mobile Leadership 
<br><br>
We intend to extend our leadership in mobile commerce through mobile product improvements that enhance consumer experience. We intend to build upon our strength in mobile commerce to develop a broader spectrum of consumer offerings, such as location-based services, O2O services and digital content, in order to fulfill our vision of becoming central to the everyday lives of our customers. In addition, we have launched mobile apps for sellers to manage their online storefronts and maintain relationships with their customers, thereby enhancing the loyalty among merchants toward our platform. We will also continue to look for ways to increase our mobile user base and engagement through strategic alliances, investments and acquisitions. 
<br><br>
By pursuing this “user first” strategy to focus on user experience enhancement and user base expansion, we believe that we will be able to drive more GMV that will provide economic benefits to our sellers and create additional monetization opportunities in the future. We will continue to gather data insights and explore ways to monetize user traffic on our mobile platform without disrupting user experience. 
<br><br>
Enhance the Success of Sellers on a Broad Basis 
<br><br>
We aim to increase the success of a broad base of sellers on our marketplaces by increasing their exposure to relevant buyer demand and providing them with more tools such as data science applications to manage their relationships with customers, in order to enable a more personalized shopping experience. We offer Qianniu ( 千牛 ), an integrated platform for communication and productivity tools that allows sellers on Taobao Marketplace and Tmall to manage their operations more efficiently. Sellers also use Weitao ( 微淘 ), our mobile social media platform that enables sellers to provide information regarding their brands, promotions and other topics to buyers. We use data analytics to help sellers target consumers and increase the rate of conversion from visits to transactions. In addition, through our Taobao University program, we offer sellers training and education to help them improve the operation of their online storefronts and marketing and sales activities. <br><br>
Enhance Data and Cloud Computing Technologies 
<br><br>
We believe data generated on our marketplaces can provide significant value to our customers and other ecosystem participants. We will continue to implement our data strategy through the application of data intelligence and deep learning technologies to several fields, including marketplace design, user interface, search, targeted marketing, logistics, location-based services and financial services, among others. 
<br><br>
We believe cloud computing will become an essential component of the infrastructure of e-commerce. In the past five years we have invested in and developed our proprietary cloud infrastructure to support our own businesses and those of third parties, including our sellers. We will continue to invest heavily in our cloud computing platform to support our own businesses and those of third parties. 
<br><br>
Develop Cross-border Commerce Opportunities 
<br><br>
Tmall Global C Chinese consumers buying goods shipped from overseas. To address the increasing demand for foreign brands by Chinese consumers, we have developed Tmall Global as an extension of the Tmall platform. While major foreign brands that have physical operations in China are well-represented on Tmall, we also aim to establish Tmall Global as the premier platform for overseas brands and retailers to reach Chinese consumers without the need for physical operations in China. We will continue to develop Tmall Global as the destination for Chinese consumers to gain access to foreign brands by attracting additional brands and developing more efficient cross-border payment and logistics solutions. 
<br><br>
AliExpress C worldwide consumers buying Chinese products. Through AliExpress, consumers worldwide can buy directly from manufacturers and exporters in China at attractive prices. We will continue to develop and market AliExpress globally, especially to consumers in emerging economies such as Russia, Eastern Europe and South America, where quality products from China at direct-to-consumer prices offer significant value. 
<br><br>
Alibaba.com C Chinese wholesale exports to the world. Alibaba.com is a global online wholesale marketplace. We seek to expand our import/export marketplace by growing the number of paying members, as well as offering additional value-added services such as customs clearance, VAT rebate services for our exporters and cross-border logistics solutions.

	<b><a name="T25">Our Ecosystem and Its Participants </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Overview <br><br>

Buyers and sellers are at the heart of our ecosystem. Buyers and sellers discover, select and transact with each other on our platform. Third-party service providers add value to our platform through service offerings that make it easier for buyers and sellers to do business. The third-party participants in our ecosystem include a payment services provider, logistics providers, retail operational partners, marketing affiliates, independent software vendors and various professional service providers. 
<br><br>

<a href= "pic79.html">Our Ecosystem and Its Participants</a><br><br>
We have developed key policies and procedures that maintain the health and sustainability of our marketplaces, including consumer protection programs, marketplace rules, qualification standards for merchants and buyer and seller rating systems. We have agreements, arrangements and relationships with our ecosystem participants ― buyers, sellers and third-party service providers. We also have strategic alliances with and or investments in leading China Internet companies such as AutoNavi and Weibo. <br><br>

We are invested in the success of every participant in our ecosystem and we strive to ensure that our ecosystem partners capture their fair share of the economics. <br><br>

As our ecosystem expands, new jobs are created. According to a research report jointly authored by AliResearch, our internal research division, and the School of Social Sciences of Tsinghua University, as of June 2013, the merchants on Taobao Marketplace and Tmall employed approximately 9.7 million people to work directly for the online storefronts of those merchants. In addition, various service providers in logistics, marketing, consulting, operations outsourcing, training and other professions employed approximately 2.0 million people, according to the same source. 
<br><br>
Value Proposition to Consumers <br><br>

The large and growing number of the consumers we serve and the increasing frequency with which they shop on our marketplaces reflect our value proposition to consumers. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, we had 231 million annual active buyers who placed an average of 49 orders during this period. 
<br><br>
Anything you want, anytime, anywhere. With 796 million product and service listings offered by sellers on our China retail marketplaces across over 100 product categories and approximately 2,000 sub-categories as of December 31, 2013, consumers have access to a wide selection of products ranging from high volume items to more niche, tailored and personalized products, or so-called “long-tail” products, all through our websites and mobile apps on a 24-hour a day, 7-day a week basis. <br><br>

Delightful shopping experience. We believe that our marketplaces deliver a delightful shopping experience to consumers. According to Forrester Research, Tmall and Taobao Marketplace received the number one and number two highest Customer Experience Index rankings, respectively, among all the retailers that Forrester tracked in China in 2014. In the Forrester study, of the 46 Chinese and non-Chinese brands surveyed in the retail, airline, hotel and banking industries, Tmall was the only retail industry brand out of a total of four brands that received an “excellent” overall ranking. It also received an excellent score for “meeting needs” and “being easy to do business with.” 
<br><br>
We believe that the following factors drive the consumer experience on our platform: 
<br><br>
Selection and value for money. With 8 million annual active sellers on Taobao Marketplace in 2013 and over 100,000 brands on Tmall as of December 31, 2013, our marketplaces offer consumers competitive pricing across a broad range of categories. 
<br><br>
Personalization. Our data analytic and data management capabilities allow us to anticipate buyer needs and tailor product offering displays, matching buyers with the most relevant merchants. 
<br><br>
Reliability. Consumers rely on feedback on the sellers, product reviews and seller rating systems to give them the transparency and comfort they need in choosing from whom to buy. 
<br><br>
Product quality and consumer protection. Our marketplace rules encourage sellers to make product quality their priority. Sellers on Tmall are required to offer consumer protection programs, such as guaranteed returns and product warranties. Sellers on Taobao Marketplace are required to offer certain consumer protection measures and may also choose to participate in additional return and warranty programs. The sellers who participate in additional consumer protection programs generally do more business on our marketplace. 
<br><br>
Convenient payment. The escrow services provided by Alipay on our China and International retail marketplaces are designed to make payment safe, fast and easy for consumers who use that service whether they shop on a computer or a mobile device. 
<br><br>
Reliable and timely delivery. The central logistics information system we provide through China Smart Logistics enables sellers to fulfill and deliver orders in timely and reliable ways, with real-time information being provided to buyers on delivery status. Logistics service providers, such as express delivery companies, relied on this information system to fulfill and deliver an average of 13.7 million packages per day to consumers in 2013. 
<br><br>
Value Proposition to Sellers 
<br><br>
Cost-effective customer acquisition with scale. We believe our marketplaces are the top choices for sellers, whether they are wholesalers or retailers, to establish a presence to gain access to buyer traffic. In December 2013, sellers on our China retail marketplaces could reach on average over 100 million unique visitors per day. 
<br><br>
Taobao and Tmall have become synonymous with online and mobile shopping in China. Consumers come to our online or mobile platform with strong commercial intent, which drives high conversion rates for merchants. In addition, we provide sellers with data analytics that enable them to more effectively target their offerings and marketing efforts to increase the rate they convert shoppers to buyers. Accordingly, we believe our marketplaces to be an effective and cost-efficient way to acquire online customers in China. 
<br><br>
In addition, sellers can extend their consumer reach through our ecosystem of marketing affiliates. Taobao Affiliate Network, one of the leading marketing affiliate networks in China, enables merchants to generate incremental traffic from third-party affiliates to their storefronts and product listings. For example, Weibo, a leading social media platform in China in which we have an equity investment, offers merchants a marketing medium for messages and alerts such as new products and special promotions with a reach of 144 million monthly active users during March 2014. 
<br><br>
Brand building and promotions. Many retailers have successfully built brand awareness and run brand promotions on our retail marketplaces. Because we do not compete with merchants who sell on our marketplaces, brands and retailers embrace Tmall as a platform to distinguish their own brand identities and build brand awareness and image. Through real-time interactions with consumers who have commercial intent, Tmall enables retailers to run special promotions and targeted marketing campaigns utilizing data and interactive media in ways that cannot be achieved through traditional media or social networking platforms. 
<br><br>
Infrastructure support for sellers. Sellers not only build their storefronts and product catalogues on our marketplaces; they also rely on our platform for a range of essential support services to operate their businesses. These include Web-based and mobile interfaces to manage listings, orders and customer relationships, as well as cloud computing services for their enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and client relationship management, or CRM, systems. Through China Smart Logistics, we provide sellers with performance analytics on their logistics partners, including delivery performance, customer satisfaction ratings and complaint statistics. Sellers can place shipment orders with our partner logistics providers directly through the China Smart Logistics platform. Through the shipment ordering systems, we aim to enable sellers to improve the buyer shopping experience by providing performance analytics and tools such as shipment fee calculators. 
<br><br>
Direct sourcing for merchants. We enable merchants to source products through 1688.com, our domestic wholesale marketplace. Retail merchants have access to a transaction system developed by us to efficiently connect and transact with sellers on 1688.com. By connecting wholesalers and manufacturers with merchants on our retail marketplaces, we make it possible for producers to shorten the distribution chain and for retail merchants to have access to a more cost-effective direct sourcing channel. 
<br><br>
Financing for sellers. Our SME loan business offers financing to certain sellers on our marketplaces. We believe that these financing products can be structured and distributed in a more cost-effective way because we are able to use data from our marketplaces to make informed marketing, credit and risk management decisions. 
<br><br>
Value Proposition to Third-party Service Providers 
<br><br>
Marketing affiliates. We believe Taobao Affiliate Network is the largest affiliate marketing network in China based on revenue shared with affiliates. Taobao Affiliate Network is powered by Alimama, our proprietary online marketing technology platform. Through this platform, sellers place marketing displays on our marketing affiliates’ websites and mobile apps, and sellers pay us a performance-based marketing fee primarily based on cost-per-click, or CPC, and cost-per-sale, or CPS, models. A significant portion of the marketing fees is shared with the participating affiliates. 
<br><br>
Logistics providers. Our scale and the data generated from transactions on our marketplaces enable us to work closely with our logistics partners C including warehouse operators, line haul services providers and express delivery services C to improve the quality of their services. Through China Smart Logistics, we provide real-time information to our logistics partners, including key operating metrics such as distribution center utilization rates, route planning data and order volume forecasts. This information allows our logistics partners to operate more efficiently by optimizing their warehouse, transport and people resources to effectively meet consumer demand. 
<br><br>
We collaborate with logistics partners to develop solutions that are tailored for product categories that require special handling, such as perishables, frozen items, large appliances, home improvement products and furniture. This creates additional business opportunities for our logistics partners. 
<br><br>
Retail operational partners. As more brands and retailers expand into e-commerce, they look to outsource certain functions to third parties who have experience conducting business on online and mobile commerce platforms. These functions include product planning, supply chain management, inventory storage and fulfillment, marketing and storefront management, customer relationship management and customer service. 
<br><br>
Independent software vendors, or ISVs. ISVs provide software tools as well as systems integration services to sellers. Our China retail marketplaces provide open application programming interfaces, or APIs, for ISVs to develop and distribute services for merchants to customize their storefronts. In addition, ISVs that provide systems integration services help merchants manage their ERP and CRM systems that are hosted on our cloud computing platform. 
<br><br>
Professional services. The large scale of economic activity on our marketplaces has spawned a number of specialized professional services being offered to merchants. These include, among others, photography specialists, models for clothing and accessories, customer service agents, Internet marketing consultants and professional buying agents. 
<br><br>
The Network Effect on and across Our Marketplaces 

 <br><br>
The interactions between buyers and sellers create network effects in that more merchants attract more consumers, and more consumers attract more merchants. In addition, our marketplaces are interconnected in that many buyers and sellers on one marketplace also participate in the activities on our other marketplaces, thereby creating a second-order network effect that further strengthens our ecosystem. 
<br><br>
The chart below depicts this network effect dynamic in our ecosystem.

<br><br>
<a href= "pic81.html">Our Marketplaces </a><br><br>

Taobao Marketplace 
<br><br>
We launched Taobao Marketplace in 2003 as a free platform for buyers to explore and discover products and sellers to establish a low-cost online presence. Taobao means “search for treasure” in Chinese and has become synonymous with online shopping in China. Users may access Taobao Marketplace anytime, anywhere through the Taobao website, our Mobile Taobao App and our mobile-optimized website. According to iResearch, Taobao was the number one C2C marketplace in terms of gross merchandise volume in China in 2013. Our Mobile Taobao App has been the most popular mobile commerce app in China from August 2012 to February 2014 (the most recent month available) in terms of mobile MAUs, according to iResearch. Our Mobile Taobao App not only serves as an extension of desktop access to Taobao Marketplace but has additional in-app services that cater to mobile users, such as comparison shopping, location-based services, social engagement, digital entertainment and payments. For example, Weitao, one of our in-app services on Mobile Taobao App, is a social media platform where buyers sign up to follow a seller and see news and promotions published by the sellers they follow. 
<br><br>
We believe Taobao Marketplace has the most extensive collection of products and services among online marketplaces globally, ranging from everyday to hard to find items. Through personal computers and mobile devices, buyers browse, search and compare products, explore and discover new trends, communicate with sellers and settle transactions with the escrow payment services provided by Alipay anywhere and anytime. The substantial majority of products listed on Taobao Marketplace consist of new merchandise and we believe Taobao Marketplace appeals to buyers, especially younger consumers, who value ease of use, a large product selection and price competitiveness. Taobao Marketplace had over 100 million average daily visitors in December 2013. With the large number of daily visitors, Taobao Marketplace acts as a starting point for buyers to explore, discover and use our marketplaces and services. For example, Taobao Marketplace drives significant organic traffic to Tmall, lowering customer acquisition costs across our marketplaces. 
<br><br>
Taobao Marketplace is open to everyone. Sellers on Taobao Marketplace are primarily individuals and small businesses. Anyone selling on Taobao Marketplace must verify their identity, pass an online examination on Taobao Marketplace rules and execute an honor code pledge. Through individual online storefronts, sellers list their products and services and complete transactions with buyers. In 2013, there were 8 million active sellers on Taobao Marketplace. In addition to serving buyers and sellers in large cities, Taobao Marketplace also benefits buyers and sellers from lower tier cities. During 2013, 140.2 million active buyers, or approximately 61% of all active buyers on our China retail marketplaces, were located outside of tier 1 and tier 2 cities, while approximately 4.1 million sellers, or approximately 51% of total active sellers on our China retail marketplaces, were located outside of tier 1 and tier 2 cities. 
<br><br>
Major physical product categories on Taobao Marketplace include apparel and accessories, electronics and appliances, home furnishings, maternity and baby products. Major virtual and digital products on Taobao Marketplace include pre-paid phone and game cards and lottery tickets. 
<br><br>
In 2010 we started offering Taobao Local Service, a platform that allows consumers to discover services offered by local merchants and that offers a channel for traditional offline service providers to execute O2O strategies. Taobao Local Services may be accessed through both personal computers and our mobile apps. An example of a local service is Taobao Diandian, our app for restaurant pre-order and takeaway dining service. Other Taobao Local Services include Taobao Travel and Taobao Movie. These and certain of our other mobile apps are described below.

The creation of storefronts and listings are free of charge to sellers. The escrow payment services provided by Alipay are free of charge to buyers and sellers unless payment is funded through a credit card, in which case Alipay charges a fee to the seller based on the related bank fees charged to Alipay. We generate revenue on Taobao Marketplace from sellers who purchase P4P and display marketing services to direct traffic to their storefronts either on Taobao Marketplace, Tmall or Juhuasuan. In addition, we also acquire additional traffic for our marketplaces from third-party marketing affiliate websites. We also generate subscription fee revenue from sellers who pay for our storefront software, including a suite of tools to upgrade, decorate and manage their online storefronts.

Furnishing a house on Taobao C Meeting everyday needs 

 <br><br>

   
Although she had no experience in interior design or the lodging business, having previously familiarized herself with the wide range of product listings and convenience of Taobao Marketplace in decorating a home with her husband in Hubei province, Du Jin decided to realize her dream of setting up a guest house in an idyllic spot in a remote region in China. Du, along with some of her friends decided to establish a guesthouse near a natural spring in the mountainous region near Lijiang, a town in Yunnan province, renowned for its natural beauty, but far away from any major commercial center. Sourcing all of the guesthouse furniture and decorations from Taobao Marketplace C from beds and sofas, to tea sets, pillows and curtains and lighting fixtures C Du and her friends not only overcame the logistical challenges of getting the required furnishings to a remote area in China but also differentiated the style of their guesthouse from others in the area, which tended to follow a single-style as those guesthouses all sourced their items locally. Du noted that aside from the convenience and comprehensiveness of the shopping experience on Taobao Marketplace, she also cherished the opportunity to communicate with and get to know many of the merchants through their interactions in the course of the project.
 <br><br>
Living @ Mobile Taobao C Anytime, anywhere 
<br><br>
 

   
Wei Shi frequently travels from Hangzhou to Shanghai to spend weekends with his girlfriend. Before taking the train to Shanghai one morning, Wei opened up the Mobile Taobao App on his smartphone to purchase movie tickets and fruit for that evening and also bought a bouquet of flowers from a seller offering same-day delivery. Mobile Taobao has become a destination for products and services for our users’ everyday lives, such as booking cinema tickets and taxis, and ordering take-out meals and gifts for delivery, anytime, anywhere.
 <br><br>
The Taobao Dream Car C Buying virtually anything on Taobao 

 <br><br>

   
  
Two car aficionados grew up in China in the 1980s, a time when cars were enough of a novelty that children would run to watch whenever one drove by. The two decided to challenge themselves with building their own hand-crafted working sports car. One of the biggest challenges was the sourcing of thousands of auto parts necessary to build the car. They decided to turn to Taobao Marketplace which had over 270,000 auto parts sellers to purchase parts used to build the car to complete the project within a year. Named the “Dream,” the car is a fully functioning model and was showcased at the Beijing International Car Show in April 2012.

Taobao village ― Linking villages to nationwide markets 

 <br><br>

   
Dongfeng is a small village in Shaji town located in Jiangsu province. Historically, the villagers were primarily engaged in waste plastic processing and farming. In 2006, Han Sun, a local resident, decided to embark on a new business ― furniture manufacturing and selling on Taobao Marketplace. Han’s success spurred others in the village to follow and their operations have led to local investments in areas such as training programs, product design and logistics. By December 31, 2013, 37 delivery and logistics service providers had established a presence in Shaji to support the local industry of selling on Taobao Marketplace, according to AliResearch. Today, annual sales on the online furniture storefronts operated by residents in Shaji exceed RMB2 billion, with several hundred of the local sellers each achieving annual sales of over RMB5 million.
<br><br>
 

As of November 30, 2013, there were approximately 20 Taobao Villages in China, according to AliResearch. A Taobao Village generally refers to rural areas where at least 10% of the households are independently involved in e-commerce on Taobao Marketplace and generating a total GMV of over RMB10 million.

	<b><a name="T27">Tmall</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We launched Tmall in 2008 as an online platform featuring brands and retailers with each seller having a uniquely identifiable online storefront. Users may access Tmall anytime, anywhere through the Tmall website and the mobile apps and mobile-optimized websites provided by Taobao Marketplace and Tmall. According to iResearch, Tmall is the largest brands and retail platform in China in terms of GMV in 2013, including direct sales companies and platform operators. 
<br><br>
Tmall caters to online and mobile consumers looking for branded products and a premium shopping experience. It is a trusted platform for consumers to buy both homegrown and international branded products and products that are not available in traditional retail outlets. Brands and retailers operate their own stores on the Tmall platform with unique identities, look and feel, enabling sellers to control their own branding and merchandising. We believe the strong buyer traffic, autonomy and flexibility for sellers to operate their own stores, and the fact that Tmall does not operate a direct sale business to compete for customer traffic, make Tmall the platform of choice for brands and retailers. Because of the presence of a large number of global brands and the stringent requirements for merchants to operate on Tmall, a presence on Tmall has become a validation of quality, allowing merchants to take advantage of our significant traffic to extend and build brand awareness. 
<br><br>
Major physical product categories on Tmall include apparel and accessories, electronics and appliances, home furnishings, home appliances, maternity and baby products. Major virtual items on Tmall include pre-paid phone and game cards. 
<br><br>
Tmall has also pioneered new business models to leverage consumer demand for special product categories, such as fresh produce as detailed in “― Tmall Case Studies ― Tmall ― Connecting American farmers to Chinese consumers.” 
<br><br>
In 2009, Tmall pioneered November 11, known as “Singles Day” in China, as an annual promotional shopping day. Singles Day was established as an annual promotional event on Tmall to reward consumers through discounts. On November 11, 2013, our China retail marketplaces generated GMV of RMB36.2 billion (US$5.8 billion) settled through Alipay within a 24-hour period. 
<br><br>
In 2014, we launched Tmall Global, which is a platform for international brands to offer products directly to consumers in China. Tmall Global offers Chinese consumers access to branded products sourced and fulfilled directly from overseas, without the need to travel abroad. In addition, consumers may directly settle payments with the international merchant in Renminbi through Alipay’s international settlement services. 
<br><br>
International brands that set up storefronts on Tmall Global benefit from the exposure to the hundreds of millions of visitors on Taobao Marketplace and Tmall, enabling them to establish their brand awareness in China without the need for a physical presence in China. International merchants can register and set up a storefront with Tmall Global with, among other things, registered trademarks from jurisdictions of their home countries. A growing number of foreign brands from the United States, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong have used Tmall Global as a stepping stone into China. Representative product categories include maternity and baby products, health food and cosmetics and skincare products. 
<br><br>
Sellers on Tmall and Tmall Global pay commissions based on a pre-determined percentage of GMV for transactions settled through Alipay that varies by product category, and typically ranges from 0.5% to 5%. Sellers also pay an annual upfront service fee, up to 100% of which may be refunded depending on sales volume achieved by the seller within each year. Sellers also pay a security deposit to back-stop potential claims under our consumer protection programs. 
<br><br>
Tmall Case Studies 
<br><br>
Gap ― Extending its online reach 
<br><br>
In February 2011, Gap launched its Tmall flagship store to increase its reach to Chinese consumers. While Gap already operates physical storefronts in 21 cities in China, it supplements its already well-known brand by expanding its offerings to consumers online, reaching beyond China’s tier 1 and tier 2 cities. 
<br><br>
On the Tmall platform, Gap enhances its efficient operations through strategic marketing, utilizing data generated from Tmall and capitalizing on Tmall’s capability to display the right product at the right time. Through its Tmall flagship store, Gap’s products were sold to consumers in over 300 cities in China in 2013. 
<br><br>
Inman ― Success of a Tao-brand 
<br><br>
The story of Inman began in 1998. Starting out as a small garment manufacturer in Guangzhou, Mr. Jianhua Fang designed and manufactured sports and casual clothing for export to Korea, Taiwan and other regions. Leveraging the power of the Internet to provide his products to overseas business buyers, Jianhua became a member on Alibaba.com in 2005. As business continued to grow, Jianhua acquired expertise in supply chain management in the apparel business, and became convinced that developing his own brand was the only way to understand customers’ needs. In 2007, Jianhua established the female casual apparel brand Inman on Taobao Marketplace, positioning his products with an artistic aesthetic presentation. Believing that he could improve Inman’s brand image through Tmall, Jianhua became one of the first merchants to open a flagship store on Tmall in 2008. Since then, Inman has become one of the most popular female apparel brands on Tmall. In the Singles Day promotion in 2013, Inman was one of the top-grossing merchants in the women’s apparel category on Tmall in terms of gross merchandise volume. 
<br><br>
Tmall― Providing safety and peace of mind for parents 
<br><br>
Demand for high-quality, imported baby formula in China has grown significantly in recent years. In order to provide authentic, high-quality products of verifiable origin directly to Chinese families, Tmall partnered with Danone Group and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Nutricia Early Life Nutrition in August 2011 to launch its official brand flagship stores on Tmall, offering a number of baby formula brands. In 2013, Nutricia Early Life Nutrition sold approximately 3,000,000 packs of baby formula on Tmall. 
<br><br>
Nutricia Early Life Nutrition used a pre-sales model whereby the manufacturer ships directly to consumers from the site of production in Europe so Chinese parents could purchase baby formula with peace of mind about its origin, quality and after-sales service. 
<br><br>
Tmall― Connecting American farmers to Chinese consumers 
<br><br>
In the summer of 2013, Tmall and the Agricultural Trade Office in Shanghai of the United States Department of Agriculture partnered to sell Chinese consumers fresh American cherries, before they were even harvested in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Utah. Consumers placed deposits to reserve boxes of cherries and once the cherries were picked, they were delivered from tree to table within 72 hours through specialized refrigerated transport that we organized with our logistics providers. More than 170 tons of American cherries were sold, and farmers in the United States were able to accurately gauge demand and ship only what had been pre-sold to ensure freshness. 
<br><br>
The cherry project is just one of many where we have made fresh overseas produce and perishables available to Chinese consumers, including blueberries from Chile, tulips from The Netherlands, king crab from Alaska and lobsters from Canada. 
<br><br>
Juhuasuan Group Buying Marketplace 
<br><br>
Launched in 2010, Juhuasuan was the most popular online group buying marketplace in China based on its monthly active users in 2013, according to iResearch. We believe Juhuasuan is the largest online group buying site in the world based on gross merchandise volume in 2013. GMV generated on Juhuasuan amounted to RMB47.7 billion (US$7.7 billion) in 2013. 
<br><br>
Juhuasuan offers quality products at discounted prices by aggregating demand from numerous consumers. Juhuasuan mainly does this through flash sales which make products available at discounted prices for a limited period of time. Juhuasuan offers distinct group buying channels featuring branded and private label products, products made to custom specifications and local services. The majority of sellers on Juhuasuan are also Tmall sellers. 
<br><br>
Major product categories on Juhuasuan include apparel and accessories, electronics and appliances, home appliance products, beauty and health products and home furnishings. 
<br><br>
Sellers on Juhuasuan pay a placement fee for promotional slots for a specified period and a commission based on a pre-determined percentage of GMV settled through Alipay, which varies by product category. 
<br><br>
1688.com 
<br><br>
1688.com is a leading online wholesale marketplace in China. 1688.com offers membership packages for sellers to establish an online presence to market relevant product information to wholesale buyers involved in domestic trade in China. We have extended our business model to create a transaction platform on 1688.com to help wholesalers transact with buyers and the majority of buyers are merchants on our retail marketplaces. The majority of sellers on 1688.com are Chinese wholesalers, suppliers or distributors. 1688.com also acts as a wholesale channel for merchants doing business on our retail marketplaces to source products from domestic wholesalers. 
<br><br>

Sellers may also pay for additional services, such as premium data analytics, and online marketing services such as P4P marketing services and keyword bidding. 
<br><br>
AliExpress 
<br><br>
We launched AliExpress in 2010. This global consumer marketplace enables consumers from around the world to buy directly from wholesalers and manufacturers in China. On AliExpress, consumers have access to a wide variety of products. 
<br><br>
In addition to the global English-language site, AliExpress operates two local language sites in Russia and Brazil. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, the leading countries where active buyers on AliExpress were located were Russia, the United States and Brazil. Sellers primarily consist of small and medium-sized businesses located in China. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
AliExpress Case Study <br><br>
Party supplies from AliExpress 
<br><br>
A mother of three school-age children and living in California, Julie Degnan decided to change her career and started her own business leveraging her skills as a cake decorator and her corporate experience in online marketing. Julie began using AliExpress to purchase cake decorations and party supplies that she was unable to find locally and at competitive prices. Three years later, her company, Cakes and Kids, is a thriving venture. 
<br><br>
Alibaba.com <br><br>

Alibaba.com was our first online commerce platform, launched in 1999. Alibaba.com is a leading English-language wholesale platform focused on supporting global trade, which was China’s largest global online wholesale marketplace by revenue in 2013, according to iResearch. Sellers on Alibaba.com are typically manufacturers and distributors based in China and other manufacturing countries such as India, Pakistan, the United States and Japan. 
<br><br>
Sellers on Alibaba.com may pay for an annual Gold Supplier membership to host a premium storefront with product listings on the marketplace. Sellers may also purchase an upgraded membership package to receive value-added services such as upgraded storefront management tools, P4P marketing services, higher rankings from keyword search, custom clearance, VAT refund and other import/export business solutions. Buyers on Alibaba.com are located in numerous countries all over the world, with the United States, India and the United Kingdom being among the leading countries. Buyers are typically SMEs engaged in the import and export business, trade agents, and wholesalers, retailers and manufacturing companies. Major categories of products purchased on Alibaba.com include consumer electronics, machinery and apparel. We employed a field sales force of 3,474 people in 78 cities across mainland China, as well as in Hong Kong and one city in Taiwan as of December 31, 2013. These sales personnel are engaged in selling membership packages to sellers who want to establish storefronts on this marketplace. <br><br>

Alibaba.com Case Study <br><br>

The Little Yoga Mat Company ― Entrepreneurship using Alibaba.com 
<br><br>
Jensen Wheeler Wolfe, of New York City, decided that she wanted to teach yoga classes for children but she could not find appropriately sized yoga mats. Jensen initially tried cutting up adult-sized yoga mats, but she wanted a better solution. On Alibaba.com, she found a manufacturer in Taiwan to create mats that are biodegradable, hypoallergenic and non-toxic. Six months after taking her first order, Jensen is now working full-time for The Little Yoga Mat company, which she founded. She has two part-time staffers, one is her bookkeeper and the other handles online orders, and her mats are sold in approximately 150 stores across the United States. 
<br><br>
Marketing Services 
<br><br>
Our marketing technology platform, Alimama, offers sellers on our marketplaces the following types of marketing services for both personal computer and mobile devices: 
<br><br>
 

--P4P marketing service: Using our P4P marketing services platform, sellers bid for keywords that match product or service listings appearing in search or browser results on a CPC basis at prices established by our online auction system, which facilitates price discovery through a market-based bidding mechanism. Over time, we have improved the effectiveness of P4P marketing services by  refining the algorithms based on consumer behavior and transaction activity. P4P marketing services are provided both on our marketplaces as well as through third-party marketing affiliates. 
 

 <br><br>

--Display marketing: We offer display marketing on selected areas of the landing pages, channel pages and delivery confirmation pages of Taobao Marketplace and Tmall. Display marketing is typically used to promote recognized product brands or for promotional events. Sellers bid for display positions on the relevant marketplace or through our third-party marketing affiliates at fixed prices or prices established by a real-time bidding system on a CPM basis.  
<br><br>
Alimama also offers our sellers these marketing services via third parties through the Taobao Affiliate Network, which we believe is the largest online marketing affiliate network in China in terms of revenue shared with our affiliates. Through the Taobao Affiliate Network, we also offer the Taobaoke Program, which connects sellers to our affiliate marketing partners for the placement of P4P services and marketing displays on the affiliate partners’ websites. Sellers on Taobao Marketplace and Tmall pay us commissions based on a percentage of GMV for transactions settled through Alipay from users sourced from third-party marketing affiliates. A significant portion of that commission is shared with our third-party affiliate partners. 
<br><br>
In addition, sellers may pay placement fees to purchase promotional slots on our Juhuasuan marketplace for a specified period. 
<br><br>
TANX 
<br><br>
The Taobao Ad Network and Exchange, or TANX, was one of the earliest and is one of the largest, real-time online advertising exchanges in China. Powered by Alibaba Cloud Computing, TANX automates the buying and selling of billions of advertising impressions on a daily basis by third parties. TANX enables more transparent pricing of advertising inventory, which improves online marketers’ return on investment. Participants on TANX include publishers, merchants, demand side platforms, and third-party data and technology companies. 
<br><br>
Data Management Platform 
<br><br>
We also offer a data management platform, or DMP, connected to TANX. Our DMP allows participants on TANX to evaluate and select online advertising inventory using both behavioral data they provide us as well as data from browsing behavior and shopping history. By customizing and tagging attributes of consumers, participants on TANX are able to evaluate online advertising inventory even more precisely and reach their targeted audiences more efficiently. 
<br><br>
DMP Case Study 
<br><br>
 
Using offline data to target a wider online consumer base 
<br><br>
German car maker Mercedes Benz utilized our DMP to expand the universe of targetable customers. Mercedes Benz implemented a marketing campaign for smart, its compact car brand, on Taobao Marketplace, during a promotional event in December 2013. By matching data collected from visitors to their physical showrooms to our DMP, we were able to identify the showroom visitors who also visited our China retail marketplaces and our partner websites and to add additional attributes to the data set using our proprietary algorithm. We then ran an online marketing program on behalf of Mercedes Benz to deliver targeted advertisements to a much larger set of potential customers with similar attributes without disclosing personally identifiable information. Mercedes Benz reported to us a noticeable increase in foot traffic following launch of the campaign. 
<br><br>
Cloud Computing 
<br><br>
Alibaba Cloud Computing supports our e-commerce ecosystem by providing a distributed computing infrastructure to handle the large volume of traffic and data generated on our online marketplaces. Our cloud computing infrastructure serves our own platform, our affiliated companies and Alipay, and provides cloud computing services to our sellers and other third parties.

As of December 31, 2013, over 980,000 customers were using Alibaba Cloud Computing services directly or indirectly through ISVs. The reliability and scalability of our cloud computing platform is evidenced, for example, by our successful processing of 254 million orders within 24 hours during our Singles Day promotion on November 11, 2013. 
<br><br>
The following table sets forth the types of customers and services used by our cloud computing customers: 
<br><br>

Alibaba Cloud Computing Case Studies <br><br>
Migrating small businesses to Alibaba Cloud Computing in a time of urgent need 
<br><br>
Shenzhen Nuozhong, a seller of small household and kitchen appliances, participated in the November 2012 Singles Day promotion and received approximately 15,000 orders during that day. At that time, Shenzhen Nuozhong was still utilizing local servers and its system could not handle the large influx of orders. After learning of this situation, our team worked with Shenzhen Nuozhong to migrate the company’s ERP systems over to Alibaba Cloud Computing and restore business operations. During the 2013 Singles Day promotion, Alibaba Cloud Computing ensured the smooth handling of over 60,000 orders, or four times the number of orders during the 2012 Singles Day promotion. <br><br>
Maintaining mission critical pharmaceutical databases through Alibaba Cloud Computing 
<br><br>
When government authorities had concerns about possible contamination in a locally distributed batch of vaccine, they approached CITIC 21, one of our affiliated companies, which maintains a nationwide database of pharmaceutical batch identity information on our Alibaba Cloud Computing system. CITIC 21 was able to locate all of the approximately 200,000 unused doses from the same vaccine batch within the same day so that the authorities could take precautionary measures against the spread of more contaminated vaccines. <br><br>

Tools and Enablers <br><br>

Tools and Enablers for Buyers <br><br>

Our tools for buyers enable them to navigate and search our marketplaces, complete transactions efficiently and provide input on their buying experience. <br><br>

Search, explore and discover <br><br>

We offer search functions on all of our Web pages, mobile apps and many of our marketing affiliates’ websites and apps to make it easy for buyers to find products and services within our marketplaces. In addition to basic product information and sales volumes, search results include other relevant content such as sellers’ sales history, ratings and customer feedback. We also use our proprietary algorithm that takes into account the context of the search to provide a highly relevant search experience. <br><br>

When a buyer conducts a search on Taobao Marketplace, the results include storefront and product listings across both Taobao Marketplace and Tmall to better meet the buyer’s needs and provide the most relevant results. 
<br><br>
Feedback and rating systems <br><br>

After a transaction is completed, a buyer can rate a seller based on various criteria, including whether the received product matches its description, a seller’s service level and delivery timeliness. These criteria form the basis of the detailed service rating, or DSR. Aggregate DSR scores for each seller over the past six months are displayed prominently on a storefront. DSR scores also affect a seller’s ranking on search results pages. 
<br><br>
Tools and Enablers for Sellers <br><br>

Our tools for sellers help them improve their online storefronts, manage their businesses and make their operations more efficient.<br><br>
Storefront management <br><br>

We offer a suite of tools that assist sellers on Taobao Marketplace in upgrading, decorating and managing their storefronts under the Wangpu ( 旺铺 ) application which is available for a subscription fee. For smaller sellers, we provide Wangpu for free. With Wangpu, our sellers can customize their storefront displays easily and use the various functional modules such as promotion campaign tools, popularity monitoring tools, collaborative marketing tools and customer service tools to manage their online marketing operations. <br><br>

Communication <br><br>

We offer Aliwangwang ( 阿里旺旺 ), a personal computer-based instant messenger that supports text, audio and video communication. We developed Aliwangwang to facilitate open communication between buyers and sellers on Taobao Marketplace and Tmall. Buyers and sellers use it as a tool for a wide range of tasks including negotiation of prices, customer services and delivery notification, in addition to the basic messaging functions. For mobile communications between buyers and sellers, we offer Wangxin ( 旺信 ), a mobile instant messenger app. 
<br><br>
Productivity management <br><br>

We offer Qianniu ( 千牛 ), an integrated platform for communication and productivity tools which allows sellers on Taobao Marketplace and Tmall to manage their operations more efficiently. Available on both personal computers and mobile devices, Qianniu offers a unified interface for sellers to access a number of our tools such as Wangpu, Aliwangwang and Alimama. <br><br>

Taobao services platform <br><br>

In 2010, we launched the Taobao Services Platform where a large number of retail operational partners, ISVs and professional services providers provide services to our sellers. 
<br><br>
Third-party retail operational partners with e-commerce expertise provide services that improve the operational efficiency of the sellers on our marketplaces. Major categories of services provided by retail operational partners include product planning, supply chain management, inventory storage and fulfillment, marketing promotion and storefront management and CRM services. <br><br>

In addition, we operate an open platform on which ISVs offer software tools and system integration services to sellers. Through an API offered by our China retail marketplaces, ISVs develop and distribute services for merchants to individualize their storefronts and perform storefront management functions. 
<br><br>
The scale of the economics generated on our marketplaces has spawned a large number of professional services providers who offer a wide range of e-commerce-related services to our sellers. Such professional services providers include photography specialists, customer service agents, Internet marketing consultants and professional buying agents. 
<br><br>
To maintain and monitor the quality of services provided in our ecosystem, we set specific standards that our third-party service providers must meet in order to be eligible to offer services on the Taobao Services Platform. 
<br><br>
Taobao model platform 
<br><br>
In 2010, the Taobao Model Platform was established to consolidate search in the fragmented fashion modeling industry by creating an online platform on which merchants and other parties can find appropriate models based on relevant criteria. As of December 31, 2013, there were over 40,000 models on the Taobao Model marketplace.

In order to meet our current and future logistics demands, we established a distributed and scalable logistics system which links a network of logistics providers to our proprietary information platform, which is operated by China Smart Logistics. We do not directly own the physical infrastructure but instead work with a variety of logistics partners to ensure we can connect buyers and sellers throughout China. Our logistics platform provides real-time access to information for both buyers and sellers, as well as information that allows delivery service providers to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their services. Such an approach is uniquely suited to our marketplace model because: 

 <br><br>

--unlike a first-party logistics model where goods are shipped out of the e-commerce company’s own inventory to customers, our proprietary model facilitates the delivery of packages from millions of sellers to hundreds of millions of buyers, all geographically dispersed across China.  

 <br><br>

--while the express delivery industry in China has grown rapidly and there is significant capacity, the industry is relatively fragmented, and as a result we developed the skillset to work with multiple delivery partners to achieve flexible and responsive service and cost effectiveness for both sellers and buyers; and  

 <br><br>

--by working with multiple delivery companies, sellers on our marketplaces can provide a range of different shipping options to buyers such as normal or express delivery at different prices, and, through our platform, both buyers and sellers have the ability to track packages from order through delivery.  

<br><br>
China Smart Logistics is the wholly-owned subsidiary of a joint venture we formed in 2013 with five major express delivery companies in China that provide services on our China retail marketplaces, as well as firms specializing in real estate development. We own a 48% equity interest in the joint venture. Together with these partners, we will continue to look for ways to develop and expand the reach of our logistics platform. 
<br><br>
Logistics process 
<br><br>
When a customer orders a product from a seller on our marketplaces, the seller selects a delivery partner to fulfill the order. The selected delivery company picks up the package from the seller, while the package status details are loaded into the delivery company’s transportation management system that transmits real time updates to us. This allows buyers and sellers to access tracking information online until the package is delivered. The selected delivery company is responsible for end-to-end delivery. The delivery companies utilize their well-developed transport networks, parts of which may be outsourced, to move packages from the seller directly to the buyer’s door or to a self-service pick-up station selected by the buyer. The buyer then provides feedback on delivery companies which is then accessible to both sellers and delivery companies. In 2013, approximately 1.3 billion packages from transactions on our China retail marketplaces were delivered within 48 hours from shipment to the end customer. Customers can choose longer delivery times at lower cost, and we estimate that the average delivery time of packages tracked by us from shipment to the end consumer was approximately three days. 
<br><br>

Network of logistics providers 
<br><br>
We have established a network of logistics providers through China Smart Logistics. China Smart Logistics has agreements with logistics providers covering several areas, including data sharing, delivery commitments, pricing and services for specific product categories. This network allows sellers to select one of many different logistics providers depending on their needs. The 14 strategic delivery partners working with our logistics platform have a national network and the top six of these delivery partners handled the majority of packages generated on our marketplaces in 2013. We believe orders from transactions generated on our marketplaces represented a significant portion of our logistics partners’ total delivery volumes in 2013. According to data provided by them as of March 2014, our top 14 delivery partners employed over 950,000 delivery personnel in more than 600 cities and 31 provinces, directly controlled municipalities and autonomous regions in China. Collectively they operated more than 1,700 distribution centers and more than 100,000 delivery stations. This network managed the delivery of 5.0 billion packages from our China retail marketplaces to consumers in 2013. 
<br><br>
The map belows illustrates the nationwide infrastructure managed by our 14 strategic delivery partners according to data provided by them as of April 2014: 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic84.html">Network of logistics providers</a><br><br>
Proprietary logistics information platform 
<br><br>
We have developed a proprietary logistics information platform, operated by China Smart Logistics, which links buyers, sellers and logistics partners and allows them to share information on delivery status, order specifics and user feedback. Our logistics information system can interface with a broad range of systems including our marketplace transaction systems, in addition to third party systems such as the transportation management systems of the delivery companies, and the CRM, ERP and warehouse management systems of sellers. This information serves many purposes for sellers, logistics providers and buyers. For example, sellers can review the performance of delivery service providers on different routes. Logistics providers can compare their performance against their peers. Buyers can track their purchases on their personal computers and mobile devices. 
<br><br>
Our logistics platform provides the following services and benefits to consumers: 

 <br><br>

--delivery time prediction, where we estimate the delivery time of parcels shipped by participating sellers based on our data, allowing them to provide enhanced delivery certainty for buyers;  
<br><br>
 

--real-time package tracking through our website and mobile interfaces, enabling buyers to plan for receipt of their orders;  
--self-service pick-up, where the buyer chooses a convenient location for pick-up from our participating network of convenience stores and other locations, allowing buyers to pick up packages at a time and place convenient for them; and  

 <br><br>

--logistics service evaluations, where the buyer may provide feedback on the logistics service, enabling sellers and logistics service providers to improve their services.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T29">Payments and Other Financial Services </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Alipay 
<br><br>
Alipay, our related company, provides payment and escrow services for transactions on Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, 1688.com and certain of our other sites as well as to third parties in China. Alipay is the principal means by which buyers and sellers settle transactions on our China retail marketplaces. We pay Alipay a fee for the payment and escrow services it provides on our marketplaces. See “Related Party Transactions ― Agreements and Transactions Related to Small and Micro Financial Services Company and its Subsidiaries.” 
<br><br>
In a typical transaction on our China retail marketplaces, the buyer would have various options to pay for purchases, including with the buyer’s fund balance in his or her personal Alipay account, credit card or transfers from an online bank account. Personal Alipay accounts may be funded by electronic fund transfer or pre-paid cards, as well as linked directly to the buyer’s credit card or bank debit card under Alipay’s “express payment” function. Whether the buyer chooses to pay with the buyer’s fund balance in his or her Alipay account, credit card or bank transfer, the transaction is settled through Alipay’s escrow and payment processing service C funds are transferred from the buyer to Alipay’s escrow account, and Alipay releases the funds from escrow to the seller only after the buyer has confirmed receipt of goods in satisfactory condition or failed to object to the release of funds within a specified time period. Buyers and sellers may also choose to settle transactions outside of Alipay through other mutually agreed upon payment method, such as cash on delivery. 
<br><br>
In 2013, 78.6% of GMV on our China retail marketplaces was settled through Alipay’s escrow and payment processing services. On Tmall and Juhuasuan, we earn commissions only on transactions that are settled through Alipay. 
<br><br>
SME Loan Business 
<br><br>
We started our SME loan business in 2010. Our SME loan business provides micro loans to sellers on our wholesale and retail marketplaces through lending vehicles licensed by the local government. Using transactional and behavioral data from sellers on our retail and wholesale marketplaces, we have developed a proprietary credit assessment model through which we evaluate our borrowers’ ability to service loans, assign credit scores to each borrower, pre-approve credit limits and extend loans. As of December 31, 2013, our SME loan business had over 342,000 borrowers with a total outstanding loan balance, net of allowance for doubtful accounts relating to micro loans, of RMB12.4 billion (US$2.0 billion). 
<br><br>
Customer Service 
<br><br>
Scalable customer service platform 
<br><br>
We trust that our customers can serve their customers better than we do, and our job is to empower them to do their job better. Our business size necessitates a highly scalable approach to customer service, and we achieve this by leveraging our ecosystem through the following methods: 

 <br><br>

--We provide sellers on our marketplaces the tools that enhance their ability to directly serve buyers. Since sellers desire repeat business, they are highly motivated to provide high-quality service. We pioneered the use of our free instant messengers, Aliwangwang (personal computer) and Wangxin (mobile), to enable buyers to connect real-time with sellers, so that sellers can respond to pre-purchase inquiries as well as provide after-sale service. Many of our merchants have multiple instant messenger accounts managed by their own customer service representatives.  

 <br><br>

--We have built a network of mostly university students who serve as part-time customer service representatives to support our online instant messaging service platform. As of the end of December 2013, approximately 4,500 part-time representatives were active in providing services to our customers.  

 
<br><br>
--We also have a dedicated in-house team of over 2,000 customer service representatives focused on serving consumers and businesses on our marketplaces through telephone hotlines, real-time instant messaging and online inquiry systems.  
<br><br>
Return and exchange policy 
<br><br>
For physical products except perishable food items, customized products and certain jewelry, consumers on our China retail marketplaces can request to return or exchange goods within seven days from the receipt of goods. We require our sellers to confirm receipt of such return requests, or file for a dispute, within five days and provide an address for the returns. If the seller agrees or does not respond within five days, the refund will be transferred to the buyer’s Alipay account automatically out of the escrow account for the transaction after the buyer has submitted a valid package tracking number to our system. 
<br><br>
Dispute resolution 
<br><br>
In the case of disputes with a seller, a buyer can submit evidence through our dispute resolution system and seek compensation from the seller. In 2013, we received dispute cases representing less than 0.08% of annual orders placed on our China retail marketplaces. To resolve minor disputes that might otherwise require disproportionate time and effort on our part, we developed a system to leverage the collective experience of volunteers who are often loyal customers of our China retail marketplaces to serve on an adjudication panel for disputes. During December 2013, approximately 7,800 volunteers served on the panel. These volunteers review cases and make their deliberations through an online forum. The determination of the panel is final and provides an easy way for buyers and sellers to resolve their disputes. The panel of volunteers also contributes to our ecosystem by suggesting improvements to our marketplace rules. More significant disputes are refered to our customer service representatives. 
<br><br>
Consumer Protection and Transaction Platform Safety Programs 
<br><br>
Consumer Protection Programs 
<br><br>
Consumer protection fund. We believe every consumer has the right to safety and protection from false and misleading claims. We encourage our sellers to make product quality a priority and have set up various programs such as the following: 
<br><br>
 

--Tmall. All Tmall sellers are required to contribute to and maintain a consumer protection fund for the benefit of buyers. Consumer protection fund deposit requirements range from RMB50,000 to RMB150,000 for standard storefronts and in some instances could be higher depending on the number of brands represented.  
<br><br>
 

--Taobao Marketplace. Sellers on Taobao Marketplace are required to offer certain consumer protection measures and may also choose to participate in additional return and delivery services programs. All Taobao marketplace merchants are required to sign agreements with us authorizing us to make deductions from their Alipay accounts in the event of confirmed consumer claims. In addition, the majority of Taobao Marketplace merchants maintain individual consumer protection funds whose minimum amounts ranged from RMB1,000 to RMB10,000 in 2013.  
<br><br>
Many sellers deposit beyond the platform minimum requirement to demonstrate their confidence in the quality of their services and products. To offer better services to consumers, some sellers make additional service commitments such as expedited shipment, free maintenance for electronics and installation services for furniture purchases. We incentivize sellers to set up customer protection funds by programming our search results to prioritize the rankings of product listings for sellers who have established these funds. In addition, the consumer protection fund amounts are displayed on the seller’s information page. 
<br><br>
As of December 31, 2013, our China retail marketplace sellers’ consumer protection funds deposited in their respective Alipay accounts in aggregate totaled over RMB12 billion. 
<br><br>
If the amounts in the sellers’ consumer protection funds are not sufficient, we may choose to compensate buyers for such losses, although we are not legally obliged to do so. 
<br><br>
Measures against counterfeit products. To protect consumers, brand owners and legitimate sellers and to maintain the integrity of our marketplaces, we have put in place a broad range of measures to prevent counterfeit and pirated goods from being offered and sold on our marketplaces. These measures include: 

 <br><br>

--identifying, issuing warnings and taking down counterfeit products from our marketplaces;  

 <br><br>

--providing an online complaint platform for brand owners to report infringements;  

 <br><br>

--conducting random checks by using third parties to purchase suspected counterfeit products on our marketplaces; and  

 
<br><br>
--enhancing our communication with various relevant government authorities to eradicate sources of counterfeit goods.  
<br><br>
We have also established cooperative relationships with over 1,000 major brand owners and several industry associations in connection with intellectual property rights protection to enhance the effectiveness of our take-down procedures and other anti-counterfeiting measures. 

<br><br>

Measures against fictitious transactions. We have implemented measures to prevent, detect and reduce the occurrence of fictitious transactions on Taobao Marketplace and Tmall including: 

 
<br><br>
--requiring the use of sellers’ real identities to set up accounts with us;  
<br><br>
 

--analyzing transaction patterns to identify anomalies;  

 <br><br>

--dynamic password protection and real-time monitoring of user login behavior;  

 <br><br>

--enabling buyers and sellers to report suspicious transactions to us;  

 <br><br>

--maintaining a “blacklist” of sellers and buyers who have been involved in fictitious transactions in the past; and  
<br><br>
 

--collaborating with industry partners and law enforcement authorities on Internet security.  
<br><br>
Penalties. We maintain a “no tolerance” policy with regard to counterfeit and fictitious activities on our marketplaces. However, because many sellers doing business on our marketplaces depend on us for their livelihood, we have generally eschewed a “shoot-first, ask questions later” approach to handling complaints. When we receive complaints or allegations regarding infringement or counterfeit goods, we follow well-developed procedures to verify the nature of the complaint and the relevant facts before de-listing the items. Generally, we give sellers who have been accused of posting or selling counterfeit products up to three days to refute the allegations and provide evidence of the authenticity of the product. 
<br><br>
If allegations of posting or selling counterfeit products have not been refuted or fictitious activities have been confirmed, we penalize the parties involved through a number of means including: 

 <br><br>

--immediately delisting the products;  

 <br><br>

--arranging for the seller to reimburse the buyer;  
<br><br>
 

--assessing penalty points against the seller or limiting its ability to add listings for a certain period;  
<br><br>
 

--adopting a “name and shame” policy;  

 <br><br>

--imposing restrictions from participation in promotional activities on our marketplaces; and  
<br><br>
 

--closing down storefronts and, for Tmall sellers, confiscating the consumer protection security deposits paid. The seller is banned permanently from establishing another storefront on our marketplaces.  
<br><br>
In appropriate circumstances we also notify the relevant law enforcement and other authorities to take legal action against the offending party, including in extreme cases criminal proceedings. 

<br><br>

	<b><a name="T30">Our Technology </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Technology is key to our success in achieving efficiency for our business, improving the user experience, and enabling innovation. As of December 31, 2013, we employed a team of over 7,000 engineers engaged in building our technology platform and developing new online and mobile products. Key components of our technology include: 
<br><br>
Cloud Computing 
<br><br>
Our cloud computing platform, called Apsara, is a general purpose distributed computing platform built with proprietary technology that enable servers clusters to perform with enhanced computing power. Apsara offers a suite of cloud services including elastic computing, database storage and services, and large-scale data processing services through Web-based API. A single Apsara cluster can be scaled up to 5,000 servers with 100 petabyte storage capacity and 100,000 CPU cores. 
<br><br>
Content Delivery Network 
<br><br>
We operate what we believe to be one of the largest and fastest content delivery networks in China, called AliCDN. The technology underlying AliCDN accelerates the loading of billions of product photographs on web pages delivered to hundreds of millions of users and offers them a fast and smooth experience. 
<br><br>
Data Science 
<br><br>
Our data science technology serves various types of data-intensive computational needs, including deep learning, high-volume batch processing and multi-variable and multi-dimensional real-time analytics. The data mining and transaction, payment and behavioral data science capabilities are used extensively in numerous applications such as search and online marketing on our marketplaces, and credit profiling and risk management of our SME loan business. 
<br><br>
Distributed Relational Database 
<br><br>
We believe that OceanBase, our proprietary distributed relational database management system is one of the largest database systems for online transaction processing in the world. OceanBase runs on servers and can be scaled up to hundreds of nodes to achieve scalability. OceanBase plays a critical role in supporting transaction processing on our marketplaces in a cost-efficient manner. 
<br><br>
Search and Online Marketing 
<br><br>
We believe we have the industry’s most comprehensive standard product unit, or SPU, database that was built on the vast amount of items listed on Taobao Marketplace and Tmall. The transactional and user behavior data generated on our marketplaces enable us to construct a powerful search engine that generates personalized results. 
<br><br>
Our online marketing technology platform powers our performance-based online and display marketing on our marketplaces and on Taobao Affiliate Network, as well as our real-time online bidding systems. It supports millions of online marketers and delivers tens of billions of online marketing impressions every day. Our online marketing technology enables us to continuously improve the effectiveness of our online marketing services for our sellers through the use of aggregated behavioral targeting data and analytics. 
<br><br>
Deep Learning 
<br><br>
Alimama utilizes cloud-based deep learning extensively to enhance the consumer targeting efficiency of our P4P marketing, display marketing and DMP service offerings. Supported by our Apsara cloud computing system, Alimama operates a cluster of servers that is capable of analyzing terabytes of data points for the modeling of tens of billions online advertising impressions. With rich consumer data generated from our China retail marketplaces, we utilize our proprietary algorithms to evaluate the quality of advertising inventory from thousands of publishers and make predictions of click through rates and conversion rates of online marketing messages. This capability enables sellers to improve consumer targeting efficiency and enhance the return on investments for online marketers. 
<br><br>
Security 
<br><br>
We are committed to maintaining a secure e-commerce ecosystem. Every day, our backend security system handles more than 15 million instances of malicious attacks to safeguard the security on our platform. In 2012, more than 60% of the phishing sites in China were identified and reported by our security technology according to the 2012 annual report of the Anti-Phishing Alliance of China, a sub-division of CNNIC. Our proprietary anti-phishing software has an installed base of more than 200 million users, and protects users from phishing websites in real-time. 
<br><br>
Sales and Marketing 
<br><br>
We employ a variety of methods to attract potential sellers and buyers, registered users, paying members, online marketers and other ecosystem participants and promote our brands. Our user base has expanded primarily through word-of-mouth. 
<br><br>
We generate the majority of our revenues through online marketing services to our sellers. As these sellers are mostly participants on our marketplaces, we do not need to rely on a large sales force for our retail marketplaces. The majority of our sales staff are engaged in selling membership packages to registered members of our wholesale marketplaces through telephone sales and field sales. 
<br><br>
Intellectual Property 
<br><br>
We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade names, trade secrets, patents and other proprietary rights is critical to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, fair trade practice, copyright and trade secret protection laws and patent protection in China and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and our trademarks. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with all of our employees, and we rigorously control access to our proprietary technology and information. As of December 31, 2013, we had 323 issued patents and 837 publicly filed patent applications in China and 512 issued patents and 1,762 publicly filed patent applications in various countries internationally. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. 
<br><br>
Competition 
<br><br>
We face competition principally from established Chinese Internet companies, such as Tencent, Baidu and their respective affiliates, as well as from offline retailers, in particular those offline retailers establishing e-commerce websites. These competitors generate significant traffic and have established brand recognition, significant technological capabilities and significant financial resources. The areas in which we compete include: 
<br><br>
 

--Buyers C We compete to attract, engage and retain buyers based on the variety and value of products and services listed on our marketplaces, overall user experience and convenience, online communication tools, integration with mobile and networking applications and tools, mobile apps and availability of payment settlement and logistics services.  
<br><br>
 

--Sellers C We compete to attract and retain sellers based on our size and the engagement of buyers, the effectiveness and value of the marketing services we offer, commission rates and the usefulness of the services we provide including data and analytics for potential buyer targeting, cloud computing services and the availability of support services including payment settlement and logistics services.  
<br><br>
 

--Talent C We compete for motivated and effective talent and personnel, including engineers and product developers to build compelling apps, tools and functions for all participants in our ecosystem.  
<br><br>
We also face competition from major global Internet companies. However, at this time, foreign e-commerce companies have a limited presence in China. 
<br><br>
Employees 
<br><br>
As of March 31, 2012, March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013, we had a total of 21,930, 20,674 and 20,884 full-time employees, respectively. Substantially all of our employees are based in China. 
<br><br>
 

The following table sets out the breakdown of our full-time employees by function as of December 31, 2013:

	<b><a name="T31">Corporate Social Responsibility </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Since our founding, we have been highly committed to sustainable corporate responsibility projects, both through charitable endeavors and by extending the benefits of our ecosystem to the community at large in China. We believe the best approach to corporate social responsibility is through embedding elements of social responsibility in our business model. Our achievements and initiatives in the area of corporate social responsibility include the following: 
<br><br>
Job Opportunities 
<br><br>
The breadth of our ecosystem and the range of different types of service providers needed within it create employment opportunities. In addition to providing direct business opportunities for sellers, our ecosystem has created new opportunities for service providers in logistics, marketing, consulting, operations outsourcing, training and other online and mobile commerce professions. See “ ― Our Ecosystem and Its Participants ― Overview.” We also provide training through Taobao University and Alibaba Business School, which prepare people on our platform with essential skills. We also promote job opportunities for socially disadvantaged groups and organize recruitment of disabled persons for appropriate positions on our Taobao Services Platform.
<br><br>
Charitable and Socially Responsible Activities 
<br><br>
We support and promote a number of charitable and socially responsible initiatives and programs in ways that we believe are in alignment with our core values and our mission. Since 2010, we have earmarked 0.3% of our annual revenue to fund efforts designed to encourage environmental awareness and conservation and other corporate social responsibility efforts. Since the program’s inception in 2010, RMB319 million has been set aside for various charitable causes and initiatives, including the following: 
<br><br>
Alibaba Foundation. In January 2012, we established Alibaba Foundation, a private charity fund that focuses on supporting environmental protection in China and helping the disadvantaged such as children born with heart defects in underdeveloped areas of China. The Alibaba Foundation management committee is comprised of a group of employee volunteers who are elected by our employees every three years. The management committee is responsible for the allocation of the charity fund to worthwhile initiatives. 
<br><br>
Environmental protection. We have provided financial support to various non-governmental organizations and charity funds, such as The Nature Conservancy and National Geographic Society. We have also provided different resources to enable these organizations to monitor the environment and conduct their work. 
<br><br>
Case Study―“Operation Origin Tracing” 
<br><br>
Organized by the corporate social responsibility program, Operation Origin Tracing was an event aimed at raising the awareness of water contamination and protection of water resources in China. The 76 participants in the event included volunteers from our employees and sellers on our marketplaces. Starting from Wuhu, a city in eastern China, the participants travelled along the Yangtze River and visited 10 cities, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Honghu, Yueyang, Yichang, Chongqing, Yibin and Lijiang, all the way up to the origin of the Yangtze River, where they collected water samples and focused on learning about and reporting a water-pollution related issue that was specific to the location. For example, in April 2013, the participants visited habitats of river dolphins, collected water sample and obtained an in-depth understanding of the impact of pollution on river dolphins. The participants then reported their findings on Weibo. Other topics covered included drinking water sources in urban areas, pollution caused by the paper mills and protection of natural wetlands and the environmental impact of the metallurgic industries. We also worked with a number of third-party organizations, such as the local chapters of The Nature Conservancy which helped coordinate events and shared local knowledge with us. 
<br><br>
Disaster relief. In addition to making donations, we use our platform to host donation programs and provide post-disaster support to people affected by disasters. For example, a charity fund successfully raised RMB48 million on our platform for the victims of the Ya’an earthquake in 2013 and provided free online and mobile commerce training and computer donation and repair to the victims of Sichuan earthquake in 2008. 
<br><br>
Case Study―Sichuan Earthquake 
<br><br>
At 2:28 PM on May 12, 2008, Qingchuan County in Sichuan Province was struck by an earthquake with a magnitude 8 on the Richter scale. Upon realizing the extent of the damage, we immediately began to establish a comprehensive relief program. We set up a dedicated donation channel via Alipay that raised RMB24 million from the public towards the relief efforts. Within three days, our employees had donated an additional RMB5 million. Within a week, Jack Ma led the creation of a relief task force of more than 1,000 employee volunteers, including members of our management, and we established a special disaster relief fund totaling RMB25 million. The immediate priorities were helping the elderly and people with disabilities, sourcing food and medical supplies as well as rebuilding critical infrastructure. 
<br><br>
Our efforts extended beyond urgent relief to post-disaster reconstruction. As part of our commitment to rebuilding lives and economic activity in Qingchuan, we initiated a program to support the schools, teachers and students that were affected by the disaster through sponsorships, the donation of supplies and volunteer work. Our employees made frequent visits to the stricken areas. 
<br><br>
In August 2009, we began hosting seminars and training sessions to help the residents of Qingchuan to learn basic computer skills and how to open and operate online stores to sell local specialties such as honey, mushrooms and tea. Within two years, the cumulative online sales volume on the storefronts operated by local entrepreneurs exceeded RMB2 million and created job opportunities for more than 100 people.
Employee participation. We have a dedicated team that organizes charitable activities and a dedicated website portal where employees can sign up for related events of interests. Many of our social responsibility activities were initiated by our employees, such as reading books to visually impaired children. 
<br><br>
Ecosystem participants activities. We encourage our sellers and other ecosystem participants to participate in socially responsible activities. As of December 31, 2013, there were 229 social responsibility organizations with storefronts on our China retail marketplaces to raise funds and awareness for initiatives, ranging from solving environmental issues to helping impoverished areas of China. In 2013, approximately 323,000 sellers on our platforms committed a total of approximately RMB25 million through approximately 266 million transactions. 
<br><br>
Facilities 
<br><br>
As of December 31, 2013, we occupied facilities around the world with an aggregate gross floor area of office buildings owned by us totaling 403,979 square meters, including 380,422 square meters for the headquarters of our principal operating businesses in Hangzhou, China. As of December 31, 2013, we maintained 73 offices in China and 16 offices outside China. In addition, we maintain data centers and logistics facilities in China, Hong Kong and the United States. 
<br><br>
Legal Proceedings 
<br><br>
From time to time, we have been involved in litigation relating to copyright, trademark and patent infringement, defamation, unfair competition, contract disputes and other matters in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings.

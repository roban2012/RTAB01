We operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. We are subject to a variety of PRC and foreign laws, rules and regulations across a number of aspects of our business. This section summarizes the principal PRC laws, rules and regulations relevant to our business and operations. Areas in which we are subject to laws, rules and regulations outside of the PRC include data protection and privacy, consumer protection, content regulation, intellectual property, competition, taxation, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption. See “Risk Factors ― Risks Related to Our Business and Industry ― We and Alipay are subject to regulation, and future regulations may impose additional requirements and other obligations on our business or otherwise that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.” <br><br>

Our online and mobile commerce businesses are classified as value-added telecommunication businesses by the PRC government. Current PRC laws, rules and regulations restrict foreign ownership in value-added telecommunication services. As a result, we operate our online and mobile commerce businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited through the variable interest entities, each of which is owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned by PRC citizens and holds all licenses associated with these businesses. <br><br>

The applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations governing value-added telecommunication services may change in the future. We may be required to obtain additional approvals, licenses and permits and to comply with any new regulatory requirements adopted from time to time. Moreover, substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation and implementation of these PRC laws, rules and regulations. See “Risk Factors ― Risks Related to Doing Business in the People’s Republic of China ― There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws, rules and regulations.”

Regulation of Telecommunications Services <br><br>

Under the Telecommunications Regulations of the PRC, or the Telecommunications Regulations, promulgated on September 25, 2000 by the State Council of the PRC, a telecommunication services provider in China must obtain an operating license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, or its provincial counterparts. The Telecommunications Regulations categorize all telecommunication services in China as either basic telecommunications services or value-added telecommunications services. Our online and mobile commerce businesses are classified as value-added telecommunications services. <br><br>

Foreign investment in telecommunications businesses is governed by the State Council’s Administrative Rules for Foreign Investments in Telecommunications Enterprises, issued by the State Council on December 11, 2001 and amended on September 10, 2008, under which a foreign investor’s beneficial equity ownership in an entity providing value-added telecommunications services in China is not permitted to exceed 50%. In addition, for a foreign investor to acquire any equity interest in a business providing value-added telecommunications services in China, it must demonstrate a positive track record and experience in providing such services. The MIIT’s Notice Regarding Strengthening Administration of Foreign Investment in Operating Value-Added Telecommunication Businesses, or the MIIT Notice, issued on July 13, 2006 prohibits holders of these services licenses from leasing, transferring or selling their licenses in any form, or providing any resource, sites or facilities, to any foreign investors intending to conduct such businesses in China. 
<br><br>
In addition to restricting dealings with foreign investors, the MIIT Notice contains a number of detailed requirements applicable to holders of value-added telecommunications services licenses, including that license holders or their shareholders must directly own the domain names and trademarks used in their daily operations and each license holder must possess the necessary facilities for its approved business operations and maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license, including maintaining its network and providing Internet security in accordance with the relevant regulatory standards. The MIIT or its provincial counterpart has the power to require corrective actions after it discovers any non-compliance of the license holders, and where such license holders fail to take such steps, the MIIT or its provincial counterpart has the power to revoke the value-added telecommunications services licenses.

	<b><a name="T3">Regulation of Internet Information Services </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
As a subsector of the telecommunications industry, Internet information services are regulated by the Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services, or the ICP Measures, promulgated on September 25, 2000 by the State Council and amended on January 8, 2011. “Internet information services” are defined as services that provide information to online users through the Internet. Internet information services providers, also called Internet content providers, or ICPs, that provide commercial services are required to obtain an operating license from the MIIT or its provincial counterpart. 
<br><br>
To the extent the Internet information services provided relate to certain matters, including news, publication, education or medical and health care (including pharmaceutical products and medical equipment), approvals must also be obtained from the relevant industry regulators in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations governing those industries.

	<b><a name="T4">Regulation of Advertising Services </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The principal regulations governing advertising businesses in China are: 

 <br><br>

--The Advertising Law of the PRC (1994);  

 <br><br>

--The Advertising Administrative Regulations (1987);  
<br><br>
 

--The Implementing Rules for the Advertising Administrative Regulations (2004); and  

 <br><br>

--The Administration Rules of Foreign-invested Advertising Enterprises (2008).  
<br><br>
These laws, rules and regulations require companies such as ours that engage in advertising activities to obtain a business license that explicitly includes advertising in the business scope from the SAIC or its local branches. 
<br><br>
Applicable PRC advertising laws, rules and regulations contain certain prohibitions on the content of advertisements in China (including prohibitions on misleading content, superlative wording, socially destabilizing content or content involving obscenities, superstition, violence, discrimination or infringement of the public interest). Advertisements for anesthetic, psychotropic, toxic or radioactive drugs are prohibited, and the dissemination of advertisements of certain other products, such as tobacco, patented products, pharmaceuticals, medical instruments, agrochemicals, foodstuff, alcohol and cosmetics, are also subject to specific restrictions and requirements. 
<br><br>
Advertisers, advertising operators and advertising distributors, including the businesses that certain of the variable interest entities operate, are required by applicable PRC advertising laws, rules and regulations to ensure that the content of the advertisements they prepare or distribute are true and in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violation of these laws, rules and regulations may result in penalties, including fines, confiscation of advertising income, orders to cease dissemination of the advertisements and orders to publish an advertisement correcting the misleading information. In circumstances involving serious violations, the SAIC or its local branches may revoke the violator’s license or permit for advertising business operations. In addition, advertisers, advertising operators or advertising distributors may be subject to civil liability if they infringe the legal rights and interests of third parties, such as infringement of intellectual proprietary rights, unauthorized use of a name or portrait and defamation. 
<br><br>
Although advertising services are no longer categorized as a prohibited or restricted area for foreign investment, the Administration Rules of Foreign-invested Advertising Enterprises issued on August 22, 2008 by the SAIC and the Ministry of Commerce, or the MOFCOM, require all foreign investors of advertising enterprises to have a track record in, and mainly engage in, advertising businesses overseas. The establishment of a foreign-invested advertising enterprise is also subject to pre-approval by the SAIC or its local branch.

	<b><a name="T5">Regulation of Online and Mobile Commerce </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
China’s online and mobile commerce industry is at an early stage of development and there are few PRC laws, regulations or rules specifically regulating this industry. The SAIC adopted the Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Commodities Trading and Relevant Services on May 31, 2010 and replaced those measures with the Administrative Measures for Online Trading on January 26, 2014, which became effective on March 15, 2014. The SAIC also issued the Opinions on Strengthening the Administration of Online Group Buying Operations on March 12, 2012 to subject group buying website operators to the foregoing measures, especially those relating to marketplace platform service providers. These newly issued measures impose more stringent requirements and obligations on the online trading or service operators as well as the marketplace platform providers. For example, the marketplace platform providers are obligated to examine the legal status of each third-party merchant selling products or services on the platform and display on a prominent location on the webpage of such merchant the information stated in the merchant’s business license or a link to such business license, and a group buying website operator must only allow a third-party merchant with a proper business license to sell products or services on its platform. Where the marketplace platform providers also act as online distributors, these marketplace platform providers must make a clear distinction between their online direct sales and sales of third-party merchant products on the marketplace platform.

The PRC government has promulgated measures relating to Internet content through various ministries and agencies, including the MIIT, the News Office of the State Council, the Ministry of Culture and the General Administration of Press and Publication. In addition to various approval and license requirements, these measures specifically prohibit Internet activities that result in the dissemination of any content which is found to contain pornography, promote gambling or violence, instigate crimes, undermine public morality or the cultural traditions of the PRC or compromise State security or secrets. ICPs must monitor and control the information posted on their websites. If any prohibited content is found, they must remove such content immediately, keep a record of it and report to the relevant authorities. If an ICP violates these measures, the PRC government may impose fines and revoke any relevant business operation licenses.

	<b><a name="T7">Regulation of Internet Security </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The Decision in Relation to Protection of the Internet Security enacted by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China on December 28, 2000 provides that the following activities conducted through the Internet are subject to criminal punishment: 
<br><br>
 

--gaining improper entry into a computer or system of strategic importance;  
<br><br>
 

--disseminating politically disruptive information or obscenities;  
<br><br>
 

--leaking State secrets;  
<br><br>
 

--spreading false commercial information; or  

 <br><br>

--infringing intellectual property rights.  
<br><br>
The Administrative Measures on the Security Protection of Computer Information Network with International Connections, issued by the Ministry of Public Security on December 16, 1997, prohibit the use of the Internet in a manner that would result in the leakage of State secrets or the spread of socially destabilizing content. If a value-added telecommunications services license holder violates these measures, the Ministry of Public Security and the local security bureaus may revoke its operating license and shut down its websites.

	<b><a name="T8">Regulation Relating to Privacy Protection </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Under the ICP Measures, ICPs are prohibited from producing, copying, publishing or distributing information that is humiliating or defamatory to others or that infringes upon the lawful rights and interests of others. Depending on the nature of the violation, ICPs may face criminal charges or sanctions by PRC security authorities for such acts, and may be ordered to suspend temporarily their services or have their licenses revoked. 
<br><br>
Under the Several Provisions on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services, issued by the MIIT on December 29, 2011, ICPs are also prohibited from collecting any user personal information or providing any such information to third parties without the consent of a user. ICPs must expressly inform the users of the method, content and purpose of the collection and processing of such user personal information and may only collect such information necessary for its services. ICPs are also required to properly maintain the user personal information, and in case of any leak or likely leak of the user personal information, ICPs must take remedial measures immediately and report any material leak to the telecommunications regulatory authority. 
<br><br>
In addition, the Decision on Strengthening Network Information Protection promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on December 28, 2012 emphasizes the need to protect electronic information that contains individual identification information and other private data. The decision requires ICPs to establish and publish policies regarding the collection and use of personal electronic information and to take necessary measures to ensure the security of the information and to prevent leakage, damage or loss. Furthermore, MIIT’s Rules on Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users promulgated on July 16, 2013 contain detailed requirements on the use and collection of personal information as well as the security measures to be taken by ICPs. 
<br><br>
The PRC government retains the power and authority to order ICPs to provide an Internet user’s personal information if such user posts any prohibited content or engages in any illegal activities through the Internet.

	<b><a name="T9">Regulation Relating to our SME Loan Business </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Our SME loan business is subject to regulations applicable to small loan companies and financial guarantee companies. 
<br><br>
Small loan companies. Under the Guidelines on the Pilot Operation of Small Loan Companies, or the Small Loan Companies Guidelines, jointly issued by the CBRC, and the PBOC on May 4, 2008, small loan companies are approved and regulated at the provincial, rather than national, level. The Small Loan Companies Guidelines provide guidance policies for the industry in a number of areas, including the following: 

 <br><br>

--the funds borrowed from banks by a small loan company may not exceed 50% of its net capital;  
<br><br>
 

--the balance of loans granted by a small loan company to a single borrower may not exceed 5% of the net capital of such small loan company; and  

 <br><br>

--the loan interest rate adopted by a small loan company must range from 0.9 times the benchmark loan interest rate published by the PBOC to the ceiling rate allowed by applicable law.  
<br><br>
Local provincial governments have issued various local regulations and rules to regulate small loan companies within their respective jurisdictions, and in many cases, these regulations follow the guidance policies under the Small Loan Companies Guidelines. Our small loan companies are registered in Chongqing and Zhejiang. The local rules in Chongqing provide that for a small loan company with sound corporate management and strong risk management ability, the funds borrowed from banks may reach 100% of their net capital and the loans granted to a single borrower may be up to 10% of the net capital of such small loan company. The local rules in Zhejiang require a small loan company to grant 70% of its loans to borrowers having less than RMB1 million loan balance or for agricultural purposes. 
<br><br>
Financial guarantee companies. Pursuant to the Interim Measures for the Administration of Financial Guarantee Companies, or the Guarantee Companies Measures, jointly promulgated by eight government ministries in China on March 8, 2010, financial guarantee companies are subject to the licensing, administration and supervision by provincial governments. According to the Guarantee Companies Measures, a financial guarantee company may offer various kinds of guarantees, such as loan guarantees, trade finance guarantees and project finance guarantees, provided that the outstanding guaranteed amount may not exceed ten times the net assets of such financial guarantee company. In addition, the Guarantee Companies Measures prohibit a financial guarantee company from certain business activities, such as taking deposits, granting loans, investing as a trustee and providing financial guarantees in favor of its parent company or any of its subsidiaries.

	<b><a name="T10">Regulations Relating to Consumer Rights Protection </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Our online and mobile commerce business is subject to a variety of consumer protection laws, including the PRC Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Law, as amended and effective as of March 15, 2014, and the Administrative Measures for Online Trading, both of which have provided stringent requirements and obligations on business operators, including Internet business operators and platform service providers like us. For example, consumers are entitled to return goods purchased online, subject to certain exceptions, within seven days upon receipt of such goods for no reason. To ensure that sellers and service providers comply with these laws and regulations, we, as platform operators, are required to implement rules governing transactions on our platform, monitor the information posted by sellers and service providers, and report any violations by such sellers or service providers to the relevant authorities. In addition, online marketplace platform providers may, pursuant to PRC consumer protection laws, be exposed to liabilities if the lawful rights and interests of consumers are infringed in connection with consumers’ purchase of goods or acceptance of services on online marketplace platforms and the platform service providers fail to provide consumers with the contact information of the seller or manufacturer. In addition, platform service providers may be jointly and severally liable with sellers and manufacturers if they are aware or should be aware that the seller or manufacturer is using the online platform to infringe upon the lawful rights and interests of consumers and fail to take measures necessary to prevent or stop such activity. 
<br><br>
Failure to comply with these consumer protection laws could subject us to administrative sanctions, such as the issuance of a warning, confiscation of illegal income, imposition of a fine, an order to cease business operations, revocation of business licenses, as well as potential civil or criminal liabilities.

According to the Trademark Law of the PRC, counterfeit or unauthorized production of the label of another person’s registered trademark, or sale of any label that is counterfeited or produced without authorization will be deemed as an infringement of the exclusive right to use a registered trademark. The infringing party will be ordered to cease infringement immediately, a fine may be imposed and the counterfeit goods will be confiscated. The infringing party may also be held liable for damages suffered by the owner of the intellectual property rights, which will be equal to the gains obtained by the infringing party or the losses suffered by such owner as a result of the infringement, including reasonable expenses incurred by such owner in connection with enforcing its rights. 
<br><br>
Under the Tort Liability Law of the PRC, an Internet service provider may be subject to joint liability if it is aware that an Internet user is infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others through its Internet services, such as selling counterfeit products, and fails to take necessary measures to stop that activity. If an Internet service provider receives a notice from an infringed party regarding an infringement, the Internet service provider is required to take certain measures, including deleting, blocking and unlinking the infringing content, in a timely manner. 
<br><br>
In addition, under the Administrative Measures for Online Trading issued by the SAIC on January 26, 2014, as an operator of an online trading platform, we must adopt measures to ensure safe online transactions, protect consumers’ rights and prevent trademark infringement.

	<b><a name="T13">Regulations on Tax </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
PRC Enterprise Income Tax 
<br><br>
The PRC enterprise income tax, or EIT, is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the applicable EIT Law and its implementation rules, which became effective on January 1, 2008. The EIT Law imposes a uniform enterprise income tax rate of 25% on all resident enterprises in China, including foreign-invested enterprises. 
<br><br>
The EIT Law and its implementation rules permit certain High and New Technologies Enterprises, or HNTEs, to enjoy a reduced 15% enterprise income tax rate subject to these HNTEs meeting certain qualification criteria. In addition, the relevant EIT laws and regulations also provide that entities recognized as Software Enterprises are able to enjoy a tax holiday consisting of a 2-year-exemption commencing from their first profitable year and a following 3-year-half-deduction in ordinary tax rate, while entities qualified as Key Software Enterprises can enjoy a preferential EIT rate of 10%. A number of our PRC subsidiaries and operating entities enjoy these types of preferential tax treatment. See “Taxation ― People’s Republic of China Taxation.” 
<br><br>
Uncertainties exist with respect to how the EIT Law applies to the tax residence status of Alibaba Group and our offshore subsidiaries. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with a “de facto management body” within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” which means that it is treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. Although the implementation rules of the EIT Law define “de facto management body” as a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management and control over the production and business, personnel, accounting books and assets of an enterprise, the only official guidance for this definition currently available is set forth in Circular 82 issued by the State Administration of Taxation, which provides guidance on the determination of the tax residence status of a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise, defined as an enterprise that is incorporated under the laws of a foreign country or territory and that has a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as its primary controlling shareholder. Although Alibaba Group Holding Limited does not have a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as our primary controlling shareholder and is therefore not a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise within the meaning of Circular 82, in the absence of guidance specifically applicable to us, we have applied the guidance set forth in Circular 82 to evaluate the tax residence status of Alibaba Group and our subsidiaries organized outside the PRC. 
<br><br>
According to Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are met: 

 <br><br>

--the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC;  
<br><br>
 

--decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC;  
<br><br>

--the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholders meeting minutes are located or maintained in the PRC; and  

 <br><br>

--50% or more of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.  
<br><br>
We do not believe that we meet any of the conditions outlined in the immediately preceding paragraph. Alibaba Group Holding Limited and our offshore subsidiaries are incorporated outside the PRC. As a holding company, our key assets and records, including the resolutions and meeting minutes of our board of directors and the resolutions and meeting minutes of our shareholders, are located and maintained outside the PRC. In addition, we are not aware of any offshore holding companies with a corporate structure similar to ours that has been deemed a PRC “resident enterprise” by the PRC tax authorities. Accordingly, we believe that Alibaba Group Holding Limited and our offshore subsidiaries should not be treated as a “resident enterprise” for PRC tax purposes if the criteria for “de facto management body” as set forth in Circular 82 were deemed applicable to us. However, as the tax residency status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body” as applicable to our offshore entities, we will continue to monitor our tax status. See “Risk Factors ― Risks Related to Doing Business in the People’s Republic of China ― We may be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and we may therefore be subject to PRC income tax on our global income.” 
<br><br>
In the event that Alibaba Group Holding Limited or any of our offshore subsidiaries is considered to be a PRC resident enterprise: (1) Alibaba Group Holding Limited or our offshore subsidiaries, as the case may be, may be subject to the PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income; (2) dividend income that Alibaba Group Holding Limited or our offshore subsidiaries, as the case may be, receive from our PRC subsidiaries may be exempt from the PRC withholding tax; and (3) dividends paid to our overseas shareholders or ADS holders who are non-PRC resident enterprises as well as gains realized by such shareholders or ADS holders from the transfer of our shares or ADSs may be regarded as PRC-sourced income and as a result be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%, and similarly, dividends paid to our overseas shareholders or ADS holders who are non-PRC resident individuals, as well as gains realized by such shareholders or ADS holders from the transfer of our shares or ADSs, may be regarded as PRC-sourced income and as a result be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of 20%, subject to the provision of any applicable agreement for the avoidance of double taxation. 
<br><br>
Under Circular 698, if a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of a PRC resident enterprise indirectly by disposition of the equity interests of an overseas non-public holding company and such overseas holding company is located in a tax jurisdiction that: (i) has an effective tax rate less than 12.5%, or (ii) does not tax foreign income of its residents, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, must report such disposition to the PRC competent tax authority of the PRC resident enterprise. The PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding, or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such disposition may be subject to a PRC withholding tax rate of up to 10%. Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price which is not on an arm’s length basis and results in reducing the taxable income, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment as to the taxable income of the transaction. Circular 698 was retroactively effective on January 1, 2008. On March 28, 2011, the State Administration of Taxation released SAT Public Notice 24 to clarify several issues related to Circular 698. SAT Public Notice 24 became effective on April 1, 2011. According to SAT Public Notice 24, the term “effective tax” refers to the effective tax on the gain derived from disposition of the equity interests of an overseas holding company; and the term “does not impose income tax” refers to cases where the gains derived from disposition of the equity interests of an overseas holding company is not subject to income tax in the country or region where the overseas holding company is a resident. There is uncertainty as to the application of Circular 698. If Circular 698 was determined by the tax authorities to be applicable to Alibaba Group Holding Limited, our offshore subsidiaries and our non-resident enterprise investors, Alibaba Group Holding Limited, our offshore subsidiaries and our non-resident enterprise investors might be required to expend valuable resources to comply with this circular or to establish that Alibaba Group Holding Limited, our offshore subsidiaries or our non-resident enterprise investors should not be taxed under Circular 698, which may materially and adversely affect Alibaba Group Holding Limited or our non-resident enterprise investors. See “Risk Factors ― Risks Related to Doing Business in the People’s Republic of China ― We and our shareholders face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.” 
<br><br>
Under applicable PRC laws, payers of PRC-sourced income to non-PRC residents are generally obligated to withhold PRC income taxes from the payment. In the event of a failure to withhold, the non-PRC residents are required to pay such taxes on their own. Failure to comply with the tax payment obligations by the non-PRC residents will result in penalties, including full payment of taxes owed, fines and default interest on those taxes. 
<br><br>
PRC Business Tax 
<br><br>
Pursuant to applicable PRC tax regulations, any entity or individual conducting business in the service industry is generally required to pay a business tax at the rate of 5% on the revenues generated from providing such services. However, if the services provided are related to technology development and transfer, such business tax may be exempted subject to approval by the relevant tax authorities. 
<br><br>
In November 2011, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax to Replace Business Tax. Pursuant to this plan and relevant notices, from August 1, 2013, a value-added tax will generally be imposed to replace the business tax in the transport and shipping industry and some of the modern service industries on a nationwide basis. A value-added tax rate of 6% applies to some modern service industries. 
<br><br>
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange and Dividend Distribution 
<br><br>
Foreign Exchange Regulation 
<br><br>
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans. 
<br><br>
In August 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency-registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Circular 45 on November 9, 2011 in order to clarify the application of SAFE Circular 142. Under SAFE Circular 142 and Circular 45, the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Furthermore, SAFE promulgated Circular 59 in November 2010, which tightens the regulation over settlement of net proceeds from overseas offerings, such as our initial public offering, and requires, among other things, the authenticity of settlement of net proceeds from offshore offerings to be closely examined and the net proceeds to be settled in the manner described in the offering documents or otherwise approved by our board. Violations of these SAFE regulations may result in severe monetary or other penalties, including confiscation of earnings derived from such violation activities, a fine of up to 30% of the RMB funds converted from the foreign invested funds or in the case of a severe violation, a fine ranging from 30% to 100% of the RMB funds converted from the foreign-invested funds. 
<br><br>
In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, which substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.

SAFE Circular 75 
<br><br>
Under the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 75, issued by SAFE on October 21, 2005 and its implementation rules, a PRC resident (whether a natural or legal person) is required to complete an initial registration with its local SAFE branch before incorporating or acquiring control of an offshore special purpose vehicle, or SPV, with assets or equity interests in a PRC company, for the purpose of offshore equity financing. The PRC resident is also required to amend the registration or make a filing upon (1) the injection of any assets or equity interests in an onshore company or undertaking of offshore financing, or (2) the occurrence of a material change that may affect the capital structure of an SPV. SAFE also subsequently issued various guidance and rules regarding the implementation of SAFE Circular 75, which imposed obligations on PRC subsidiaries of offshore companies to coordinate with and supervise any PRC-resident beneficial owners of offshore entities in relation to the SAFE registration process. 
<br><br>
We have notified substantial beneficial owners of ordinary shares whom we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation, and we have periodically filed SAFE Circular 75 reports on behalf of certain employee shareholders whom we know are PRC residents. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. In addition, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 75. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to SAFE Circular 75 or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 75 may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Failure to register or amend the registration may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries or receive dividends or other distributions from our PRC subsidiaries or other proceeds from disposal of our PRC subsidiaries, or we may be penalized by SAFE.

Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers. We will make efforts to comply with these requirements upon completion of our initial public offering.

Regulation of Dividend Distribution 
<br><br>
The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distribution by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations and the Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to set aside as general reserves at least 10% of their after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50% of their registered capital. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.

	<hr><br>
	
The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, issued by six PRC governmental and regulatory agencies, including the MOFCOM and the CSRC, on August 8, 2006 and amended on June 22, 2009, require that an SPV formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals must obtain the approval of the CSRC in the event that the SPV acquires equity interests in the PRC companies in exchange for the shares of offshore companies. 
<br><br>
The application of the M&A Rules remains unclear. Our PRC counsel, Fangda Partners, has advised us that, under current PRC laws, rules and regulations and the M&A Rules, prior approval from the CSRC is not required under the M&A Rules for our initial public offering because our first foreign invested company was established in 1999, prior to the adoption of the M&A Rules, and we have not acquired any equity interests or assets of a PRC company owned by our controlling shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC companies or individuals, as defined under the M&A Rules. However, as there has been no official interpretation or clarification of the M&A Rules, there is uncertainty as to how these rules will be implemented in practice. See “Risk Factors ― Risks Related to Doing Business in the People’s Republic of China ― Any requirement to obtain prior approval under the M&A Rules and/or any other regulations promulgated by relevant PRC regulatory agencies in the future could delay this offering and failure to obtain any such approvals, if required, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and reputation as well as the trading price of our ADSs, and could also create uncertainties for this offering.”

	<hr><br>
	
The PRC Anti-monopoly Law, which took effect on August 1, 2008, prohibits monopolistic conduct, such as entering into monopoly agreements, abuse of dominant market position and concentration of undertakings that have the effect of eliminating or restricting competition. 
<br><br>

Monopoly Agreement 
<br><br>
Competing business operators may not enter into monopoly agreements that eliminate or restrict competition, such as by boycotting transactions, fixing or changing the price of commodities, limiting the output of commodities, fixing the price of commodities for resale to third parties, among others, unless such agreement will satisfy the exemptions under the Anti-monopoly Law, such as improving technologies or increasing the efficiency and competitiveness of small and medium-sized undertakings. Sanctions for violations include an order to cease the relevant activities, and confiscation of illegal gains and fines (from 1% to 10% of sales revenue from the previous year, or RMB500,000 if the intended monopoly agreement has not been performed). 
<br><br>
Abuse of Dominant Market Position 
<br><br>
A business operator with a dominant market position may not abuse its dominant market position to conduct acts, such as selling commodities at unfairly high prices or buying commodities at unfairly low prices, selling products at prices below cost without any justifiable cause, and refusing to trade with a trading party without any justifiable cause. Sanctions for violation of the prohibition on the abuse of dominant market position include an order to cease the relevant activities, confiscation of the illegal gains and fines (from 1% to 10% of sales revenue from the previous year). 
<br><br>
Concentration of Undertakings 
<br><br>
Where a concentration of undertakings reaches the declaration threshold stipulated by the State Council, a declaration must be approved by the anti-monopoly authority before the parties implementing the concentration. Concentration refers to (1) a merger of undertakings; (2) acquiring control over other undertakings by an undertaking through acquiring equities or assets; or (3) acquisition of control over, or the possibility of exercising decisive influence on, an undertaking by contract or by any other means. If business operators fail to comply with the mandatory declaration requirement, the anti-monopoly authority is empowered to terminate and/or unwind the transaction, dispose of relevant assets, shares or businesses within certain periods and impose fines of up to RMB500,000. 
<br><br>
See “Risk Factors ― Risks Related to Our Business and Industry ― We may become the target of anti-monopoly and unfair competition claims, which may result in our being subject to fines as well as constraints on our business.”

Regulation on Non-financial Institution Payment Services 
<br><br>
According to the Administrative Measures for the Payment Services Provided by Non-financial Institutions, or the Payment Services Measures, promulgated by the PBOC on June 14, 2010 and effective as of September 1, 2010, as a payment institution, a non-financial institution providing monetary transfer services as an intermediary between payees and payers, including online payment, issuance and acceptance of prepaid cards or bank cards, and other payment services specified by the PBOC, is required to obtain a payment business license. Any non-financial institution or individual engaged in the payment business without such license may be ordered to cease its payment services and be subject to administrative sanctions and even criminal liabilities. Applications for payment business licenses are examined by the local branches of the PBOC and then submitted to the PBOC for approval. The registered capital of an applicant that engages in a nationwide payment business must be at least RMB100 million, while that of an applicant engaging in a payment business within a province must be at least RMB30 million. 
<br><br>
A payment institution is required to conduct its business within the scope of business indicated in its payment business license, and may not undertake any business beyond that scope or outsource its payment business. No payment institution may transfer, lease or lend its payment business license. 
<br><br>
In addition, on February 1, 2013, the SAFE promulgated the Guiding Opinions on the Pilot Services of Cross-Border E-commerce Foreign Exchange Payment by Payment Institutions, or the Guiding Opinions, pursuant to which a payment institution is required to obtain approval from the SAFE in order to provide pilot foreign exchange payment services for cross-border e-commerce transactions. Under the Guiding Opinions, payment institutions may only provide foreign exchange payment services for cross-border e-commerce transactions where there is a real underlying transaction. The payment institution must also verify the real names and identity information of the clients involved in the cross-border transaction, maintain records of the relevant transactions and make monthly reports to the local branch of the SAFE. 
<br><br>
We rely on our related company, Alipay, to provide payment services on our marketplaces and Alipay has obtained a payment business license from the PBOC as well as approval for cross-border e-commerce foreign exchange payment services from the SAFE.

Anti-money Laundering Regulations 
<br><br>
The PRC Anti-money Laundering Law, which became effective on January 1, 2007, sets forth the principal anti-money laundering requirements applicable to both financial and non-financial institutions with anti-money laundering obligations, such as Alipay, including the adoption of precautionary and supervisory measures, establishment of various systems for client identification, preservation of clients’ identification information and transactions records, and reports on block transactions and suspicious transactions. The Payment Services Measures also require that the payment institution follow the rules associated with anti-money laundering and comply with their anti-money laundering obligations. 
<br><br>
In addition, the PBOC promulgated the Administrative Measures for Payment Institutions Regarding Anti-money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing on March 5, 2012, or the Anti-money Laundering Measures, according to which the payment institution must establish and improve unified anti-money laundering internal control systems and file such systems with the local branch of the PBOC. The Anti-money Laundering Measures also require the payment institution to set up an anti-money laundering department or designate an internal department to be responsible for anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing work. 
<br><br>
In the future, if Alipay expands its business internationally, it may become subject to additional laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it chooses to operate. These regulatory regimes may be complex and require extensive time and resources to ensure compliance.

	<b><a name="T19">ALIBABA PARTNERSHIP </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Since our founders first gathered in Jack Ma’s apartment in 1999, they and our management have acted in the spirit of partnership. We view our culture as fundamental to our success and our ability to serve our customers, develop our employees and deliver long-term value to our shareholders. In July 2010, in order to preserve this spirit of partnership and to ensure the sustainability of our mission, vision and values, we decided to formalize our partnership as Lakeside Partners, named after the “Lakeside Gardens” residential community where Jack and our other founders started our company. We refer to the partnership as the Alibaba Partnership. 
<br><br>
We believe that our partnership approach has helped us to better manage our business, with the peer nature of the partnership enabling senior managers to collaborate and override bureaucracy and hierarchy. The Alibaba Partnership currently has 28 members comprised of 22 members of our management and six members of the management of our related companies and affiliates. The partnership operates under principles, policies and procedures that have evolved with our business and are described below. 
<br><br>
Our partnership is a dynamic body that rejuvenates itself through admission of new partners each year, ensuring excellence, innovation and sustainability. Unlike dual-class ownership structures that employ a high-vote class of shares to concentrate control in a few founders, our approach is designed to embody the vision of a large group of management partners. This structure is our solution for preserving the culture shaped by our founders while at the same time accounting for the fact that founders will inevitably retire from the company. 
<br><br>
Consistent with our partnership approach, all partnership votes are made on a one-partner-one-vote basis. 
<br><br>
Nomination and Election of Partners 
<br><br>
The Alibaba Partnership elects new partners annually after a nomination process whereby existing partners propose candidates to the partnership committee described below, or the partnership committee. The criteria and process the partnership applies to the election of new partners underscores accountability among the partners as well as to our customers, employees and shareholders. The partnership committee reviews the nominations and determines whether the nomination of a candidate will be proposed to the entire partnership for election. Election of new partners requires the approval of at least 75% of all of the partners. 
<br><br>
<a href= "link01.html">中国崛起的四个问题</a><br><br>
To be eligible for election, a partner candidate must have demonstrated the following attributes: 

 <br><br>

--a high standard of personal character and integrity;  
<br><br>
 

--continued service with Alibaba Group and/or our related companies or affiliates for, in most cases, not less than five years;  
<br><br>
 

--a track record of contribution to the business of Alibaba Group; and  

 <br><br>

--being a “culture carrier” who shows a consistent commitment to, and traits and actions consonant with, our mission, vision and values.  
<br><br>
In order to align the interests of partners with the interests of our shareholders, we require each partner maintain a meaningful level of equity interests in our company during such individual’s tenure as a partner. Because partner nominees generally must have been an employee of ours or one of our related companies or affiliates for at least five years, as of the time he or she becomes a partner, he or she will typically own or have been awarded a personally meaningful level of equity interest in our company through our equity incentive and share purchase plans. 
<br><br>
Duties of Partners 
<br><br>
The main duty of partners in their capacity as partners is to embody and promote our mission, vision and values. We expect partners to be evangelists for our mission, vision and values, both within our organization and externally to customers, business partners and other participants in our ecosystem. 
<br><br>
Partnership Committee 
<br><br>
The partnership committee consists of five partners and is responsible for administering partner elections and allocating among the non-executive officer partners who are our employees the portion of the annual cash bonus pool that has been allocated to the partnership by our compensation committee. Partnership committee members serve for a term of three years and may serve multiple terms. Elections of committee members are held once every three years. Prior to each election, the partnership committee nominates eight partners. All partners may vote for five nominees and the five nominees who receive the most votes from the partners are elected to the partnership committee. 
<br><br>
Director Nomination Rights 
<br><br>
Pursuant to our articles of association, as we expect them to be amended and become effective upon completion of this offering, the Alibaba Partnership will have the exclusive right to nominate a simple majority of the members of our board of directors. The election of each director nominee will be subject to the director nominee receiving a majority vote from our shareholders voting at an annual general meeting of shareholders. If an Alibaba Partnership director nominee is not elected by our shareholders or after election departs our board of directors for any reason, the Alibaba Partnership has the right to appoint a different person to serve as an interim director of the class in which the vacancy exists until our next scheduled annual general meeting of shareholders. At the next scheduled annual general meeting of shareholders, the appointed interim director or a replacement Alibaba Partnership director nominee (other than the original nominee) will stand for election for the remainder of the term of the class of directors to which the original nominee would have belonged. See “Description of Share Capital ― Ordinary Shares ― Nomination, Election and Removal of Directors.” 
<br><br>
In determining the Alibaba Partnership director nominees who will stand for election to our board, the partnership committee will propose director nominees who will be voted on by all of the partners. The Alibaba Partnership will select its director nominees by vote of a simple majority of all of the partners. The provisions relating to nomination rights and procedures described above will be incorporated in our amended articles of association effective upon the completion of this offering. Pursuant to these amended articles of association, the Alibaba Partnership’s nomination rights and related provisions of our articles of association may only be changed upon the vote of shareholders representing 95% of the votes present in person or by proxy at a general meeting of shareholders. 
<br><br>
Bonus Pool 
<br><br>
Our board of directors, acting on the recommendation of our compensation committee, approves an annual cash bonus pool for management of our company (which in fiscal year 2013 comprised approximately 150 individuals) equal to a percentage of our adjusted pre-tax operating profits. Once the annual cash bonus pool is calculated, our compensation committee will then first determine the proportion to be allocated to the non-partner members of our management. Any remaining portion will then be available for the partner members of our management. The partnership committee will determine the allocation of the relevant portion of the annual cash bonus pool for all partner members of management, with any amounts payable to our executive officers subject to approval of the compensation committee of our board of directors. A portion of the annual cash bonus pool that is available to the partner members of management will be deferred, with the deferred portion and pay-out schedule determined by the partnership committee. Participation in deferred distributions is conditioned on a partner’s continued employment with us. 
<br><br>
Retirement and Removal 
<br><br>
Partners retire from the partnership when they cease employment with Alibaba Group or its related companies or affiliates, except Jack Ma and Joe Tsai may remain as partners until they elect to retire from the partnership or are removed as partners. Any partner, including Jack and Joe, may be removed upon the vote of a simple majority of all partners. As with other partners, during the time they remain partners, Jack and Joe must maintain the shareholding levels required by us of all partners as described below. Jack and Joe will not be eligible to receive allocations from the annual cash bonus pool described below if they cease to be employed with Alibaba Group, even if they remain life partners. 
<br><br>
Restrictive Provisions 
<br><br>
Under our amended articles of association, in connection with any change of control, merger or sale of our company, the partners and other holders of our equity securities shall receive the same consideration with respect to their equity securities in connection with any such transaction. In addition, our amended articles of association will provide that the Alibaba Partnership may not transfer or otherwise delegate or give a proxy to any third party with respect to its right to nominate directors and that the consent of our independent directors shall be required for any change to the partnership agreement that would amend the procedures for nominating directors by the partnership. Our amended articles of association will also provide that the amendment of certain provisions of the Alibaba Partnership agreement relating to the partnership’s rights to nominate a majority of our board of directors will require the approval of a majority of directors who are “independent directors” within the meaning of Section 303A of the Corporate Governance Rules of the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350. 
<br><br>
Amendment of Alibaba Partnership Agreement 
<br><br>
Any amendment of the partnership agreement requires the approval of 75% of all of the members of the Alibaba Partnership. 
<br><br>
Alibaba Group Equity Interest Holding Requirement for Partners 
<br><br>
Each of the partners holds his or her equity interests in our company directly as an individual or through his or her affiliates. For a period of three years from the date on which such person becomes a partner, or in the case of the existing 28 partners, January 1, 2014, we require that each partner retain at least 60% of the equity interests (including unvested shares and shares underlying vested and unvested awards) such partner held on the relevant date. Following the initial three-year holding period and for so long as he or she remains a partner, we require that the partner retain at least 40% of the equity interests (including unvested shares and shares underlying vested and unvested awards) such partner held on the starting date of the initial three-year holding period.

Director nominees will be elected by the simple majority vote of shareholders at our annual general meeting. 
<br><br>
If a director nominee is not elected by our shareholders or departs our board of directors for any reason, the party or group entitled to nominate that director has the right to appoint a different person to serve as an interim director of the class in which the vacancy exists until our next scheduled annual general meeting of shareholders. At the next scheduled annual general meeting of shareholders, the appointed interim director or a replacement director nominee (who, in the case of Alibaba Partnership nominees, cannot be the original nominee) will stand for election for the remainder of the term of the class of directors to which the original nominee would have belonged.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T23">Employment Agreements </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers. We may terminate their employment at any time, with or without cause, and we are not required to provide any prior notice of such termination. We may also terminate their employment in circumstances prescribed under and in accordance with the requirements of applicable labor law, including relevant notice provisions, payment in lieu provisions and other relevant provisions. Executive officers may terminate their employment with us at any time upon three months written notice. Where severance pay is mandated by law, our executive officers will be entitled to such severance pay in the amount mandated by law when his or her employment is terminated. <br><br>

In addition, we have been advised by our PRC counsel that notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in our employment agreements, we may still be required to make severance payments upon termination without cause to comply with the PRC Labor Law, the labor contract law and other relevant PRC regulations, which entitle employees to severance payments in case of early termination of “de facto employment relationships” by PRC entities without statutory cause regardless of whether there exists a written employment agreement with such entities. 
<br><br>
Our grant letter agreements under our equity incentive plans also contain restrictive covenants that enable us to terminate grants and repurchase shares at the original exercise price, among other rights. See “― Equity Incentive Plans” below. <br><br>

Compensation of Executive Directors and Executive Officers 
<br><br>
In fiscal year 2014, we paid aggregate salaries and benefits of approximately US$          million to our executive officers (including executive directors) as a group and an aggregate US$          million from the share of profits distributed to them as part of the annual cash bonus pool. We do not separately set aside any amounts for pensions, retirement or other benefits for our executive officers, other than pursuant to relevant statutory requirements, and, in the case of executives who are not PRC citizens, health and life insurance. For information regarding equity-based grants to executive officers, see “― Equity Incentive Plans.” 
<br><br>
Equity Incentive Plans 
<br><br>
We have adopted the following equity incentive plans since our inception: 
<br><br>
 

 --1999 Share Option Plan, or the 1999 Plan;  

 <br><br>

 --2004 Share Option Plan, or the 2004 Plan;  

 <br><br>

 --2005 Share Option Plan, or the 2005 Plan;  

 <br><br>

 --2007 Share Incentive Plan, or the 2007 Plan; and  
<br><br>
 

 --2011 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2011 Plan.  
Currently, awards are only available for issuance under our 2011 Plan. If an award under the 2007 Plan or the 2011 Plan terminates, expires or lapses, or is cancelled for any reason, ordinary shares subject to the award become available for the grant of a new award under the 2011 Plan. As of December 31, 2013, there were: 

 <br><br>

 --4,279,500 ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and 12,077,421 issued but unvested restricted shares;  
<br><br>

 --47,670,100 ordinary shares related to outstanding RSUs; and  

 <br><br>

 --77,861,552 ordinary shares authorized for issuance under the 2011 Plan.  
<br><br>
Our equity incentive plans provide for the granting of options, restricted shares, RSUs, dividend equivalents, share appreciation rights and share payments to any directors, employees, and consultants of ours, our affiliates and related companies. Share options and RSUs granted are generally subject to a four-year vesting schedule as determined by the administrator of the respective plans. Depending on the nature and the purpose of the grant, share options and RSUs in general vest 25% upon the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date for annual incentive awards or 50% upon the second anniversary of the vesting commencement date for on-hire awards, and thereafter 25% every year. We believe share-based awards are vital to attract, motivate and retain our directors, employees and consultants, and those of certain of our related companies and affiliates and are the appropriate tool to align their interests with our shareholders. Accordingly, we will continue to grant share-based awards to our directors, employees and consultants, and those of certain of our related companies and affiliates as an important part of their compensation packages. 
<br><br>
In addition, our equity incentive award agreements generally provide that, in the event of a grantee’s termination for cause or violation of a non-competition undertaking, we will have the right to repurchase the shares acquired by such grantee, generally at par or the price paid for such shares. 
<br><br>
The following paragraphs summarize other key terms of our equity incentive plans. 
<br><br>
Plan administration. The equity incentive plans are generally administered by a committee created and appointed by the board or by our board of directors if no such committee is created or appointed. Grants to any executive directors of the board must be approved by the disinterested directors of our board. 
<br><br>
Types of awards. The equity incentive plans provide for the granting of options, restricted shares, restricted share units, dividend equivalents, share appreciation rights, share payments and other rights. 
<br><br>
Award agreements. Generally, awards granted under the equity incentive plans are evidenced by an award agreement providing for the number of ordinary shares subject to the award, and the terms and conditions of the award, which must be consistent with the relevant plan. 
<br><br>
Eligibility. Any employee, consultant or director of our company, our related companies or our affiliates is eligible to receive grants under the equity incentive plans, but only employees of ours, our subsidiaries, our related companies or our affiliates are eligible to receive incentive stock options.
<br><br>
Term of awards. The term of awards granted under our equity incentive plans are generally not to exceed ten years from the date of grant. 
<br><br>
Acceleration, waiver and restrictions. The administrator of our equity incentive plans has sole discretion in determining terms and conditions of any award, any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and any restrictions regarding any award or the ordinary shares relating thereto. 
<br><br>
Change in control. If a change in control of our company occurs, the plan administrator may, in its sole discretion, 

 <br><br>

 --accelerate the vesting, in whole or in part, of any award;  <br><br>
--purchase any award for an amount of cash or ordinary shares of our company equal to the value that could have been attained upon the exercise of the award or the realization of the plan participant’s rights had such award been currently exercisable or payable or fully vested; or  
<br><br>
 

 --provide for the assumption, conversion or replacement of any award by the successor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation, with other rights or property selected by the plan administrator in its sole discretion, or the assumption or substitution of the award by the successor or surviving corporation, or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving or successor corporation, with such appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices as the plan administrator deems, in its sole discretion, reasonable, equitable and appropriate.  
<br><br>
Amendment and Termination. Unless earlier terminated, our equity incentive plans continue in effect for a term of ten years. The board may at any time terminate or amend the 2011 Plan in any respect, including amendment of any form of share option agreement or instrument to be executed, provided, however, that to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with applicable laws or stock exchange rules, we must obtain shareholder approval of any amendment to the 2011 Plan in such manner and to such degree as required. 
<br><br>
Senior Management Equity Incentive Plan 
<br><br>
We adopted the Senior Management Equity Incentive Plan in 2010, pursuant to which selected management of our company subscribed for preferred shares in a special purpose vehicle, Alternate Solutions Management Limited, which holds our ordinary shares. These preferred shares, subject to a non-compete provision, are redeemable by the holders thereof for our ordinary shares upon the earlier to occur of an initial public offering of our shares (subject to statutory and contractual lock-up periods), and five years from the respective dates of issuance of the preferred shares to the participants. The maximum number of our ordinary shares redeemable upon the redemption of the preferred shares issued under this plan by the participants is 15,000,000. The underlying ordinary shares have already been issued to the special purpose vehicle and are included in our total issued and outstanding share number. The preferred shares are subject to forfeiture if a holder engages in certain activities that compete with us. 
<br><br>
Partner Capital Investment Plan 
<br><br>
We adopted the Partner Capital Investment Plan in 2013 to provide partners of the Alibaba Partnership an opportunity to invest in interests in our ordinary shares in order to align further their interests with the interests of our shareholders. Pursuant to the Partner Capital Investment Plan, the partners subscribed for convertible preferred shares in two special purpose vehicles, PCIP I Limited and PCIP II Limited. These convertible preferred shares are, for a period of up to four years from the respective dates of issuance thereof, convertible into exchangeable ordinary shares in these special purpose vehicles, which are exchangeable for our ordinary shares after eight years following the respective dates of issuance of the convertible preferred shares. The convertible preference shares and the exchangeable ordinary shares of these special purpose vehicles are subject to forfeiture if a partner engages in certain activities that compete with us. The maximum number of our ordinary shares that may be acquired upon the exchange of exchangeable ordinary shares in the special purpose vehicles by the partners is 18,000,000. The underlying ordinary shares have already been issued by us to the special purpose vehicles and are included in our total issued and outstanding share number. The Partner Capital Investment Plan permits the issuance of additional shares to the partners as the board may approve from time to time. 
<br><br>
The following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2013, the outstanding options (including unvested restricted shares related to options early exercised), RSUs and other rights held by our directors and executive officers, as well as by their affiliates, under 2011 Plan, as well as equity held through their investments in our Senior Management Equity Incentive Plan and Partner Capital Investment Plan.

--our directors and executive officers as a group;  
<br><br>
 

--each person known to us to beneficially own 5% or more of our ordinary shares; and  

 <br><br>

--each selling shareholder.  
<br><br>
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and includes the power to direct the voting or the disposition of the securities or to receive the economic benefit of the ownership of the securities. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we have included shares that the person has the right to acquire within 60 days of December 31, 2013, including through the exercise of any option or other right and the vesting of restricted shares. These shares, however, are not included in the computation of the percentage ownership of any other person. 
<br><br>
The calculations in the table below assume there were 2,321,114,237 ordinary shares outstanding as of December 31, 2013, including (i) 91,243,243 ordinary shares into which all of our outstanding convertible preference shares will automatically convert concurrently with the completion of this offering, (ii) 33,000,000 ordinary shares underlying preferred shares of Alternate Solutions Management Limited and convertible preferred shares of PCIP I Limited and PCIP II Limited and (iii) 12,077,421 issued but unvested restricted shares, and reflect the issuance by us of                                  ordinary shares pursuant to this offering, assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs, excluding ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding share options, RSUs and ordinary shares reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans. 
<br><br>

<a href= "pic87.html">beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares </a><br><br>
As of December 31, 2013, 171,007,006 of our outstanding ordinary shares were held by shareholders of record in the United States. We are not aware of any arrangement that may at a subsequent date, result in a change of control of our company. Each selling shareholder named above acquired its shares in offerings that were exempted from registration under the Securities Act because such offerings involved either private placements or offshore sales to non-U.S. persons.

Yahoo Technology and Intellectual Property License Agreement 
<br><br>
We entered into a technology and intellectual property license agreement dated October 24, 2005, as amended and restated on September 18, 2012, or the Yahoo TIPLA. Under the Yahoo TIPLA, Yahoo granted to us the use of certain intellectual property. In consideration of the rights granted under the Yahoo TIPLA, as amended on September 18, 2012, we paid Yahoo a lump sum payment in the amount of US$550 million and agreed to pay Yahoo an annual royalty equal to 2% of our consolidated revenues (less certain costs) for the period from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2012 and 1.5% of our consolidated revenues (less certain costs) for the period from January 1, 2013 until the completion of this offering.

For the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, the royalty fees amounted to RMB358 million, RMB592 million (US$95 million) and RMB576 million (US$93 million), respectively. 
<br><br>

We and Yahoo entered into a patent sale and assignment agreement during the nine months ended December 31, 2013 pursuant to which we acquired ownership of certain patents for aggregate consideration of US$70 million. 
<br><br>
Our Repurchase of Ordinary Shares from Yahoo 
<br><br>
We are party to a share repurchase and preference share sale agreement with Yahoo dated May 20, 2012, as amended through December 13, 2013, or the Yahoo repurchase agreement. The agreement governs the terms on which we have repurchased and may further repurchase from Yahoo, or cause Yahoo to sell in a qualified initial public offering (such as this offering), our ordinary shares. We repurchased 523,000,000 ordinary shares from Yahoo on September 18, 2012 at a price of US$13.5414 per share for an aggregate consideration of US$7,082 million. Immediately following the repurchase, Yahoo owned 523,565,416 ordinary shares representing approximately 24% of our issued share capital at that time. We paid US$6,282 million of the consideration in cash and US$800 million through our issuance to Yahoo of mandatorily redeemable preference shares of our company, or the Yahoo preference shares. We negotiated the terms of the Yahoo preference shares with Yahoo on an arm’s length basis. On May 16, 2013, we redeemed the Yahoo preference shares in full using funds we borrowed under our loan facility. 
<br><br>
The Yahoo repurchase agreement was amended to provide that we are entitled to cause Yahoo either to sell 208,000,000 (prior to such amendment, 261,500,000 ordinary shares) ordinary shares to the public in this offering or sell to us such number of shares using the proceeds from this offering. 
<br><br>
Following the expiration of the lock-up agreement SoftBank and Yahoo will enter into with the underwriters in connection with this offering, SoftBank and Yahoo will be entitled to exercise registration rights under the registration rights agreement.

<br><br>
Agreements and Transactions Related to Small and Micro Financial Services Company and its Subsidiaries 
<br><br>
Ownership of Small and Micro Financial Services Company and Alipay 
<br><br>
We originally established Alipay in December 2004 to operate our payment services. In 2011, pursuant to regulations issued by the PBOC, online payment companies were required to obtain a license in order to operate in China. These regulations stipulated that the scope of business, the qualifications of any foreign investor and any foreign ownership percentage would be subject to future additional regulations. When the licenses were first issued, no such additional regulations governing foreign-owned payment companies had been put in place. Our management determined that it was necessary for Alipay to qualify itself as a company wholly-owned by PRC nationals in order to obtain a payment license, and, accordingly, we restructured our previous ownership of Alipay to eliminate foreign ownership. 
<br><br>
Following the separation of Alipay from us, the ownership structure of Alipay’s parent entity, Zhejiang Alibaba E-Commerce Co., Ltd., which we refer to as Small and Micro Financial Services Company, a company organized under the laws of the PRC, was changed such that Jack Ma holds a substantial majority of the voting power and a significant minority direct equity ownership interest in Small and Micro Financial Services Company. The remaining equity ownership interest is held by a special purpose partnership of which partners in the Alibaba Partnership, our employees and employees of Small and Micro Financial Services Company, including Alipay, are the limited partners and of which a company wholly-owned by Jack is the general partner. Jack has indicated in writing to our board of directors his commitment to limit his direct and indirect economic interest in Small and Micro Financial Services Company at the time of any initial public offering of Small and Micro Financial Services Company, to a percentage that is not more than his beneficial ownership interest in our company immediately prior to our initial public offering. See “― Commitments of Jack Ma to Alibaba Group.” 
<br><br>
Shortly after the separation of Alipay from us, we entered into a framework agreement, a commercial agreement and an intellectual property and technology agreement described below, which together govern our financial and commercial relationships with Small and Micro Financial Services Company and Alipay. 
<br><br>
Framework Agreement 
<br><br>
Our relationship with Alipay is primarily governed through the framework agreement dated July 29, 2011, as amended on November 15, 2012 and further amended on May 3, 2014, among ourselves, Yahoo, SoftBank, Alipay, APN Ltd., an entity owned by Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, Small and Micro Financial Services Company, Jack and Joe, or the Framework Agreement. 
<br><br>
Under the terms of the Framework Agreement, we entered into a commercial agreement and an intellectual property and software technology services agreement each as described below. 
<br><br>
Upon the occurrence of certain liquidity events with respect to Alipay (which includes, subject to certain conditions, an initial public offering of Alipay, a transfer of 37.5% or more of the equity interests of Alipay or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Alipay), Small and Micro Financial Services Company will pay to us an amount equal to 37.5% of the equity value of Alipay achieved in such liquidity event, with a minimum payment of US$2.0 billion and a maximum payment of US$6.0 billion, subject to certain increases and additional payments if no liquidity event has occurred by the sixth anniversary of the date of the original agreement, or the liquidity event payment. If a liquidity event does not occur by the tenth anniversary of the date of the original agreement, we will have a right to demand Alipay to effect a liquidity event as soon as practicable, provided that the equity value or enterprise value of Alipay at such time exceeds US$1.0 billion. If we demand a liquidity event, the minimum amount of US$2.0 billion described above will not apply to the liquidity payment, unless the liquidity event is effected by means of a transfer of more than 37.5% of the equity interests of Alipay. Upon payment in full of the liquidity event payment and certain other payments, certain assets and intellectual property that we had retained will be transferred to Alipay. In the event a liquidity event has not occurred prior to the seventh anniversary of the Framework Agreement, Small and Micro Financial Services Company or APN Ltd. will pay us US$500 million on that date, which amount would be credited to any liquidity event payment that may be made in the future. 
<br><br>
In addition, pursuant to the Framework Agreement, Jack Ma contributed 35,000,000 and Joe Tsai contributed 15,000,000 of our ordinary shares held by them to APN Ltd., a special purpose vehicle they established and own, and have pledged their shares in APN Ltd. and APN Ltd. has pledged our ordinary shares held by it to secure, among other things, the liquidity event payment and certain other payment obligations of Alipay, Small and Micro Financial Services Company and certain other parties under the Framework Agreement. In addition, APN Ltd. agreed to be jointly and severally liable with Small and Micro Financial Services Company for the payments to us under the Framework Agreement, up to a maximum liability of US$500 million. 
<br><br>
Under the Framework Agreement, certain actions and matters under the Framework Agreement, the commercial agreement and the intellectual property and software technology service agreement with Alipay are subject to the approval of the directors of our company designated by Yahoo and SoftBank for so long as they are so designated. Upon completion of this offering, SoftBank will be entitled to nominate one director to our board. 
<br><br>
Alipay Commercial Agreement 
<br><br>
We are party to a commercial agreement with Small and Micro Financial Services Company and Alipay, or the Alipay commercial agreement. Under the Alipay commercial agreement, Alipay provides payment processing services to us and our subsidiaries and we pay Alipay a fee for such services on preferential terms to us. The fees reflect, among other things, bank-processing costs and accordingly are subject to adjustment to the extent such costs increase or decline. The Alipay commercial agreement provides that the directors of our company designated by Yahoo and SoftBank approve the fees payable by us in advance on an annual basis, and going forward our independent directors and the director designated by SoftBank will approve the fees in advance on an annual basis. For the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, we paid fees to Alipay amounting to RMB1,307 million, RMB1,646 million (US$265 million) and RMB1,899 million (US$305 million), respectively, under this agreement. The Alipay commercial agreement has an initial term of 50 years, and is automatically renewable for further periods of 50 years, subject to our right to terminate at any time upon one year’s prior written notice. If the commercial agreement is required by applicable regulatory authorities to be modified in certain circumstances, a one-time payment may be payable to us by Small and Micro Financial Services Company to compensate us for the impact of such adjustment. 
<br><br>
Alipay Intellectual Property and Software Technology Services Agreement 
<br><br>
Under the terms of an Intellectual Property and Software Technology Services Agreement, we, on behalf of ourselves and certain of our subsidiaries, license to Alipay certain intellectual property rights and provide various software technology services to it and its subsidiaries, and Alipay pays us a fee equal to the product of an expense reimbursement plus a royalty and software technology services fee equal to 49.9% of the consolidated pre-tax income of Alipay and its subsidiaries, subject to downward adjustments upon certain dilutive equity issuances by Small and Micro Financial Services Company or Alipay, but in no case below 30.0%. The agreement terminates at the earlier of (a) the payment in full of the liquidity event payment and (b) such time when termination may be required by applicable regulatory authorities in connection with an initial public offering of Alipay. In fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, we recognized royalty and software technology services fee income, net of costs incurred by our company, amounting to RMB27 million, RMB277 million (US$45 million) and RMB633 million (US$102 million) as other income. 
<br><br>
Share-based Award Reimbursement Arrangements 
<br><br>
We entered into agreements with Small and Micro Financial Services Company in 2012 and 2013 under which we will receive a reimbursement for options and RSUs relating to 6,106,425 ordinary shares granted to the employees of Small and Micro Financial Services Company and its subsidiaries during the period from December 14, 2011 to December 31, 2013. Pursuant to these agreements, we will, upon vesting of such options and RSUs, receive a cash reimbursement equal to their respective grant-date fair value. As this arrangement relates to share-based awards previously granted, we recognized the reimbursement as a reduction of share-based compensation expense of nil, RMB146 million (US$23 million) and RMB191 million (US$31 million) during fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, respectively.

Share-based Awards to Our Employees by a Related Party 
<br><br>
In March 2014, Hangzhou Junhan Equity Investment Partnership, or Junhan, the general partner of which is an entity controlled by Jack Ma, made a grant of certain share-based awards similar to share-appreciation awards linked to the valuation of Small and Micro Financial Services Company to most of our employees. The vesting of such awards is conditional upon the fulfillment of requisite service conditions to us, and such awards will be settled in cash by Junhan upon disposal by the holders. Junhan has the right to repurchase the vested awards from the holders upon an initial public offering of Small and Micro Financial Services Company or the termination of employment with us at a price to be determined based on the then fair market value of Small and Micro Financial Services Company. Junhan’s obligation to cash settle these awards will be funded by a contribution of ordinary shares Jack Ma holds in Small and Micro Financial Services Company and the proceeds of any sales of those shares. We have no obligation to reimburse Junhan, Small and Micro Financial Services Company or its subsidiaries for the cost associated with these awards. 
<br><br>
Data Sharing Services Used by Small and Micro Financial Services Company 
<br><br>
We have arrangements with Small and Micro Financial Services Company whereby Small and Micro Financial Services Company shares data with us at no charge for the purposes of our data management platform, audience targeting, credit analysis, and detecting, monitoring and investigating traffic hijacking and fraudulent activities. 
<br><br>
Shared Services Used by Small and Micro Financial Services Company 
<br><br>
We and Small and Micro Financial Services Company have entered into a shared services agreement, pursuant to which we and Small and Micro Financial Services Company provide certain administrative and support services to each other and our respective affiliates. 
<br><br>
Small and Micro Financial Services Company paid us RMB76 million, RMB42 million (US$7 million) and RMB63 million (US$10 million), respectively, in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013, respectively, for the services we provided to it under the agreement. Small and Micro Financial Services Company did not provide us with any services under the contract in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 or the nine months ended December 31, 2013. 
<br><br>
Transaction with Entity Affiliated with Our Executive Chairman 
<br><br>
We entered into an agreement dated as of March 26, 2013 whereby Jack Ma, our executive chairman, acquired our interest in a business aircraft for a cash consideration of US$49.7 million, which was the original purchase price of the aircraft. The aircraft was subsequently leased to us, free of charge, to be used mainly by Jack in connection with his duties as our executive chairman. We have also entered into a cost reimbursement agreement with the related company to reimburse the maintenance and incidental costs of the aircraft at cost. 
<br><br>
Relationship with an Investment Fund Affiliated with our Executive Chairman 
<br><br>
Jack Ma owns a 40% interest in several entities that are the general partners of investment funds sponsored by Yunfeng Capital. Jack will donate all distributions he may receive by virtue of his 40% interest in entities that manage the various Yunfeng Capital funds to, or for the benefit of, the Alibaba Foundation. See “― Commitments of Jack Ma to Alibaba Group.” We expect that, through its expertise, knowledge base and extensive network of contacts in private equity in China, Yunfeng Capital will assist us in developing a range of relevant strategic investment opportunities. 
<br><br>
Yunfeng Capital has historically, and may in the future, enter into co-investment transactions with us and third parties, such as our recent investments in Youku Tudou and CITIC 21. In April 2014, in conjunction with our investment in CITIC 21 and on the same terms as us, Yunfeng Capital acquired an effective equity interest of approximately 16% in CITIC 21 for a total purchase price of HK$395 million. Also in April 2014, in conjunction with our investment in Youku Tudou and on the same terms as us, Yunfeng Capital agreed to invest approximately US$132 million to purchase Class A ordinary shares of Youku Tudou, representing an effective equity interest of 2.0% on a fully-diluted basis. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ― Recent Investment, Acquisition and Strategic Alliance Activities ― Digital Media.” We have committed US$100 million as a limited partner of a private equity fund currently being raised by Yunfeng Capital with target total commitments of US$1.0 billion. Through such investment, we have formalized an institutional relationship with Yunfeng Capital.

	<b><a name="T26">Commitments of Jack Ma to Alibaba Group </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Jack Ma, our executive chairman, has confirmed the following commitments to our board of directors in writing: 

 <br><br>
<a href= "link03.html">大国不能小心眼</a><br><br>
<a href= "link04.html">全面推进依法治国</a><br><br>

--He intends to reduce and thereafter limit his direct and indirect economic interest in Small and Micro Financial Services Company over time, to a percentage that does not exceed his and his affiliates’ interest in our company immediately prior to our initial public offering and that such reduction will be caused in a manner by which neither Jack nor any of his affiliates would receive any economic benefit;  

 <br><br>

--He has entered into a deed to, and will, donate all distributions he may receive by virtue of his 40% interest in entities that manage the various Yunfeng Capital funds to, or for the benefit of, the Alibaba Foundation; and  

 <br><br>

--If required by us, while he remains an Alibaba executive, he will assume for our benefit legal ownership of investment vehicles, holding companies and variable interest entities that further our business interests in Internet, media and telecom related businesses and, in such circumstances, he will disclaim all economic benefits from such ownership and enter into agreements to transfer any such benefits to us when permitted by applicable law.  
Loan Arrangement with a Related Party 
<br><br>
In April 2014, we entered into a full recourse loan arrangement for an amount of RMB6.5 billion with Simon Xie, one of our founders and an equity holder in certain of our variable interest entities, to finance a minority investment, by a PRC partnership, in Wasu Media Holding Co., Ltd., or Wasu, a company which is listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and engaged in the business of digital media broadcasting and distribution in China. The proposed financing enables us to enter into strategic business arrangements with Wasu to enhance our digital entertainment strategy. The loan to Simon will be made at an interest rate of 8% per annum and is repayable in ten years. The loan will be collateralized by Simon’s equity interest in the PRC partnership and by the shares of Wasu held by such partnership. We have entered into strategic cooperation agreements with a major shareholder of Wasu in order to enhance our capabilities and influence in the digital media sector in China. The drawdown of the loan is pending regulatory and Wasu shareholder approval of the underlying investment, which has not yet been obtained. A company controlled by Jack Ma will serve as one of the general partners of the PRC partnership. Jack’s interest as a general partner is limited to the return of his contributed capital. 
<br><br>
Equity-settled Donation Relating to Our Ordinary Shares 
<br><br>
During the nine months ended December 31, 2013, we granted options to acquire 50,000,000 ordinary shares of us to SymAsia Foundation, a non-profit organization designated by Jack Ma and Joe Tsai. 35,000,000 and 15,000,000 of these share options will be transferred to the separate charitable trusts to be established by Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, respectively. These share options were approved by our board of directors and the options are not subject to any vesting conditions and are exercisable for a period of four years from the grant date. The exercise price of these options is US$25.00 per share based on a fair market value appraisal process. For each of the eight years beginning one year after the date of listing of our ordinary shares on a recognized stock exchange, the charitable trusts are permitted to sell only up to 6,250,000 ordinary shares (or one-eighth of the total number of ordinary shares subject to the options) per year excluding such number of unsold ordinary shares carried forward from previous years. As there are no vesting conditions attached to the above share options, equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 million (US$204 million) was recognized in full and recorded in general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended December 31, 2013. 
<br><br>
Contractual Arrangements among Our Wholly-foreign Owned Enterprises, Variable Interest Entities and the Variable Interest Entity Equity Holders 
<br><br>
Chinese law restricts foreign ownership in enterprises that provide value-added telecommunications services, which includes the ICPs. As a result, we operate our Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited in China through contractual arrangements between our wholly-foreign owned enterprises, our variable interest entities, which, where applicable, hold the ICP licenses and other regulated licenses and generally operate our Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited, and the variable interest entity equity holders. For a description of these contractual arrangements, see “Our History and Corporate Structure ― Contractual Arrangements among Our Wholly-foreign Owned Enterprises, Variable Interest Entities and the Variable Interest Entity Equity Holders.”

	<br>
	<b><a name="T27">DESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We are an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability and our affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association, and the Companies Law (2013 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, which we refer to as the Cayman Companies Law, and the common law of the Cayman Islands. 
<br><br>
As of December 31, 2013, our authorized share capital was US$70,000 divided into (i) 2,797,400,000 ordinary shares, par value US$0.000025 per share, and (ii) 2,600,000 convertible preference shares, par value US$0.000025 per share. As of December 31, 2013, there were 2,229,870,994 ordinary shares issued and outstanding, which included 12,077,421 issued but unvested restricted shares. All of our issued and outstanding convertible preference shares will automatically convert into 91,243,243 ordinary shares concurrently with the completion of this initial public offering. Following completion of this offering, our authorized capital will be US$             divided into              ordinary shares with a par value of US$0.000025 per share. 
<br><br>
Our amended memorandum and articles of association, or our articles, will become effective upon completion of this offering and will replace our existing memorandum and articles of association in its entirety. The following are summaries of material provisions of our articles, as they are expected to become effective upon completion of this offering, and the Cayman Companies Law insofar as they relate to the material terms of our ordinary shares. 
<br><br>
Ordinary Shares 
<br><br>
General 
<br><br>
All of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares are fully paid and non-assessable. Our ordinary shares are issued in registered form, and are issued when registered in our register of shareholders. Each holder of our ordinary shares will be entitled to receive a certificate in respect of such ordinary shares. Our shareholders who are non-residents of the Cayman Islands may freely hold and vote their ordinary shares. We may not issue shares to bearer. 
<br><br>
Dividends 
<br><br>
The holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors. In addition, our shareholders may by ordinary resolution declare a dividend, but no dividend may exceed the amount recommended by our directors. Under Cayman Companies Law, a Cayman Islands company may pay a dividend out of either profit or share premium account, provided that in no circumstances may a dividend be paid if this would result in the company being unable to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. 
<br><br>
Voting Rights 
<br><br>
Each ordinary share is entitled to one vote on all matters upon which the ordinary shares are entitled to vote. 
<br><br>
Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by show of hands unless a poll is demanded. A poll may be demanded by the chairman of the meeting or any shareholder holding at least 10% of the shares given a right to vote at the meeting, present in person or by proxy. 
<br><br>
An ordinary resolution to be passed by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy at a general meeting, while a special resolution requires the affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy at a general meeting (except for certain matters described below which require a higher affirmative vote, in which cases the required majority to pass a special resolution shall be 95%). Both ordinary resolutions and special resolutions may also be passed by a unanimous written resolution signed by all the shareholders of our company, as permitted by the Cayman Companies Law and our articles. A special resolution will be required for important matters such as a change of name and amendments to our articles. Our shareholders may effect certain changes by ordinary resolution, including increasing the amount of our authorized share capital, consolidating and dividing all or any of our share capital into shares of larger amounts than our existing shares and cancelling any authorized but unissued shares. 
<br><br>
Our articles provide that a special resolution shall be required, and that for the purposes of any such special resolution, the affirmative vote of no less than 95% of votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy at a general meeting shall be required to approve any amendments to any provisions of our articles that relate to or have an impact upon: 
<br><br>
 

--the right of the Alibaba Partnership to nominate directors to our board as described below under “― Nomination, Election and Removal of Directors;”  

 <br><br>

--the affirmative shareholder vote necessary to approve or authorize a merger or change of control if the Alibaba Partnership’s right to nominate directors is adversely impacted by such merger or change of control as described below under “― Differences in Corporate Law ― Mergers and Similar Arrangements;”  

 <br><br>

--the procedures regarding the election, appointment and removal of directors; and  

 <br><br>

--any alteration of the voting rights with respect to the above.

Transfer of Ordinary Shares 
<br><br>
Subject to the restrictions contained in our articles, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his or her ordinary shares by an instrument of transfer in any usual or common form or any other form approved by our board of directors, executed by or on behalf of the transferor (and, if in respect of a nil or partly paid up share, or if so required by our directors, by or on behalf of the transferee). 
<br><br>
Our board of directors may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share that has not been fully paid up or is subject to a company lien. Our board of directors may also decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share unless: 

 <br><br>

--the instrument of transfer is lodged with us, accompanied by the certificate for the ordinary shares to which it relates and such other evidence as our board of directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;  

 <br><br>

--the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of ordinary shares;  

 <br><br>

--the instrument of transfer is properly stamped, if required;  

 <br><br>

--the ordinary share transferred is fully paid and free of any lien in favor of us;  

 <br><br>

--any fee related to the transfer has been paid to us; and  

 <br><br>

--the transfer is not to more than four joint holders.  
<br><br>
If our directors refuse to register a transfer, they are required, within three months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, to send to each of the transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal. 
<br><br>
Liquidation 
<br><br>
On a winding up of our company, if the assets available for distribution among the holders of our ordinary shares shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the share capital at the commencement of the winding up, the surplus will be distributed among the holders of our ordinary shares on a pro rata basis in proportion to the par value of the ordinary shares held by them. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by the holders of our ordinary shares in proportion to the par value of the ordinary shares held by them. 
<br><br>
The liquidator may, with the sanction of a special resolution of our shareholders, divide amongst the shareholders in species or in kind the whole or any part of the assets of our company, and may for that purpose value any assets and determine how the division shall be carried out as between our shareholders or different classes of shareholders. 
<br><br>
We are a “limited liability” company registered under the Cayman Companies Law, and under the Cayman Companies Law, the liability of our members is limited to the amount, if any, unpaid on the shares respectively held by them. Our articles of association contain a declaration that the liability of our members is so limited. 
<br><br>
Calls on Ordinary Shares and Forfeiture of Ordinary Shares 
<br><br>
Our board of directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their ordinary shares. The ordinary shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid are subject to forfeiture. 
<br><br>
Redemption, Repurchase and Surrender of Ordinary Shares 
<br><br>
We may issue shares on terms that such shares are subject to redemption, at our option or at the option of the holders thereof, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by our board of directors. Our company may also repurchase any of our shares provided that the manner and terms of such purchase have been approved by our board of directors or by ordinary resolution of our shareholders (but no repurchase may be made contrary to the terms or manner recommended by our directors), or as otherwise authorized by our articles. Under the Cayman Companies Law, the redemption or repurchase of any share may be paid out of our company’s profits or out of the proceeds of a new issue of shares made for the purpose of such redemption or repurchase, or out of capital (including share premium account and capital redemption reserve) if our company can, immediately following such payment, pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. In addition, under the Cayman Companies Law no such share may be redeemed or repurchased (a) unless it is fully paid up, (b) if such redemption or repurchase would result in there being no shares outstanding or (c) if the company has commenced liquidation. In addition, our company may accept the surrender of any fully paid share for no consideration. 
<br><br>
Variations of Rights of Shares 
<br><br>
If at any time, our share capital is divided into different classes of shares, all or any of the rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-fourths of the shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights will not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with such existing class of shares. 
<br><br>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, our board of directors may issue preferred shares, without further action by the shareholders. See “― Differences in Corporate Law ― Directors’ Power to Issue Shares.” 
<br><br>
General Meetings of Shareholders 
<br><br>
Shareholders’ meetings may be convened by a majority of our board of directors or our chairman. As a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not obligated by the Cayman Companies Law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings; however, our corporate governance guidelines will provide that in each year we will hold an annual general meeting of shareholders. The annual general meeting shall be held at such time and place as may be determined by our board of directors. 
<br><br>
The Cayman Companies Law provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting, and does not provide shareholders with any right to put any proposal before a general meeting. 
<br><br>
However, these rights may be provided in a company’s articles of association. Our articles provide that upon the requisition of shareholders representing not less than one-third of the voting rights entitled to vote at general meetings, our board will convene an extraordinary general meeting and put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting. However, shareholders may propose only ordinary resolutions to be put to a vote at such meeting and shall have no right to propose resolutions with respect to the election, appointment or removal of directors. Our articles will provide no other right to put any proposals before annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings. 
<br><br>
Advance notice of at least 10 days but no more than 60 days is required for the convening of our annual general meeting and any other general meeting of our shareholders. All general meetings of shareholders shall occur at such time and place as determined by our directors and set forth in the notice for such meeting. 
<br><br>
A quorum for a general meeting of shareholders consists of any one or more shareholders present in person or by proxy, holding shares representing in aggregate not less than one-third of the voting rights entitled to vote at general meetings. 
<br><br>
Nomination, Election and Removal of Directors 
<br><br>
Our articles provide that persons standing for election as directors at a duly constituted general meeting with requisite quorum shall be elected by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders, which requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast on the resolution by the shareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy at the meeting. Our articles further provide that our board of directors will be divided into three groups designated as Group I, Group II and Group III with as nearly equal a number of directors in each group as possible. Directors assigned to Group I shall initially serve until the first annual general meeting of shareholders following the effectiveness of our articles upon completion of this offering, or the Articles Effectiveness Date; directors assigned to Group II shall initially serve until the second annual general meeting of shareholders following the Articles Effectiveness Date; and directors assigned to Group III shall initially serve until the third annual general meeting of shareholders following the Articles Effectiveness Date. Commencing with the first annual general meeting of shareholders following the Articles Effectiveness Date, each director of each group the term of which shall then expire shall, upon the expiration of his or her term, be eligible for re-election at such annual general meeting to hold office for a three-year term and until such director’s successor has been duly elected. Our articles provide that, unless otherwise determined by shareholders in a general meeting, our board will consist of not less than nine directors, for so long as SoftBank has the right to nominate a director and when SoftBank no longer has such right, not less than seven. We have no provisions relating to retirement of directors upon reaching any age limit. 
<br><br>
Our articles of association, as we expect them to be amended prior to the completion of this offering, provide that the Alibaba Partnership shall have the right to nominate such number of persons who shall stand for election as directors as may be required to ensure that directors nominated or appointed by the Alibaba Partnership shall constitute a simple majority of the total number of directors on our board of directors, with as equal a number of such nominated directors assigned to each group of directors as possible. A nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors shall have the right to determine the persons who shall stand for election as directors for the remainder of the places available for election to our board of directors, subject to the right of SoftBank to nominate one person to stand for election so long as SoftBank owns at least 15% of our outstanding shares pursuant to the voting agreement described in “Related Party Transactions ― Voting Agreement” of this prospectus. Each of the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee shall consist of at least three directors and the majority of the committee members shall be independent within the meaning of Section 303A of the Corporate Governance Rules of the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350. The audit committee shall consist of at least three directors, all of whom shall be independent within the meaning of Section 303A of the Corporate Governance Rules of the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350 and will meet the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. 
<br><br>
In the event that the appointment of any person standing for election as a director fails to be approved by a simple majority of votes cast at a duly constituted general meeting, the party that nominated such person to stand for election shall have the power to appoint a different person to the board to be a director until the next annual general meeting of shareholders after such appointment. Such appointment shall become effective upon the nominating party giving a written notice (duly signed by an authorized representative of the Alibaba Partnership, or by majority of the members of the nominating and corporate governance committee, or by an authorized representative of SoftBank, as the case may be) to the company, without the requirement for any further vote or approval by the shareholders or the board. In the event of a casual vacancy on the board due to the resignation, death or removal of a director, the party that nominated or appointed such director shall have the right to appoint a person to the board to be a director until the next annual general meeting of shareholders after such appointment. The board of directors may expand the maximum number of directors on the board, subject to any maximum number determined from time to time by the shareholders at a general meeting. The Alibaba Partnership shall be entitled to appoint such number of additional directors to the board as may be necessary to ensure that the directors nominated or appointed by the Alibaba Partnership as a simple majority of the board (such additional directors shall be designated as Alibaba Partnership nominated directors). The nominating and corporate governance committee shall be entitled to appoint any other directors up to the maximum number of directors on the board, if any (designated as nominating and corporate governance committee nominated directors). The Alibaba Partnership and the nominating and corporate governance committee shall have the right to appoint persons to the board of directors as Alibaba Partnership nominated directors and nominating and corporate governance committee nominated directors, respectively, until the next annual general meeting of shareholders after such appointment. 
<br><br>
A director will be removed from office automatically if, among other things, the director (1) dies or becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors generally; or (2) is found of unsound mind; or (3) resigns his office by notice in writing to our company. In addition, the directors nominated or appointed by the Alibaba Partnership are subject to removal, with or without cause, only by the Alibaba Partnership, the director nominated or appointed by SoftBank will be subject to removal, with or without cause, only by SoftBank. Any director nominated or appointed by the nominating and corporate governance committee may be removed for cause by a vote of the majority of the board of directors upon the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee. 
<br><br>
Proceedings of Board of Directors 
<br><br>
Our articles provide that our business is to be managed and conducted by our board of directors. The quorum necessary for the board meeting may be fixed by the board and, unless so fixed at another number, will be a majority of the directors. 
<br><br>
Our articles provide that the board may from time to time at its discretion exercise all powers of our company to raise capital or borrow money, to mortgage or charge all or any part of the undertaking, property and assets (present and future) and uncalled capital of our company and, subject to the Cayman Companies Law, issue debentures, bonds and other securities of our company, whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of our company or of any third party. 
<br><br>
Inspection of Books and Records 
<br><br>
Holders of our ordinary shares will have no general right under Cayman Companies Law to inspect or obtain copies of our list of shareholders or our corporate records. 
<br><br>
Changes in Capital 
<br><br>
Our shareholders may from time to time by ordinary resolution: 
<br><br>
 

--increase the share capital by such sum, to be divided into shares of such classes and amount, as the resolution shall prescribe; <br><br> 
--consolidate and divide all or any of our share capital into shares of a larger amount than our existing shares;  

 <br><br>

--sub-divide our existing shares, or any of them into shares of a smaller amount, provided that in the subdivision the proportion between the amount paid and the amount, if any, unpaid on each reduced share shall be the same as it was in case of the share from which the reduced share is derived; or  
<br><br>
 

--cancel any shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person and diminish the amount of our share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled.  
<br><br>
Our shareholders may by special resolution, subject to any confirmation or consent required by the Cayman Companies Law, reduce our share capital or any capital redemption reserve in any manner permitted by law. 
<br><br>
Restrictive Provisions 
<br><br>
Under our amended articles of association, in connection with any change of control, merger or sale of our company, the partners and other holders of our equity securities shall receive the same consideration with respect to their equity securities in connection with any such transaction. In addition, our amended articles of association will provide that the Alibaba Partnership may not transfer or otherwise delegate or give a proxy to any third party with respect to its right to nominate directors and that the consent of our board of directors shall be needed for any change to the partnership agreement that would amend the procedures for nominating directors by the partnership.

	<b><a name="T28">Exempted Company </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We are an exempted company with limited liability under the Cayman Companies Law. The Cayman Companies Law distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. Any company that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands may apply to be registered as an exempted company. The requirements for an exempted company are essentially the same as for an ordinary company except for the exemptions and privileges listed below: 

 <br><br>

 --an exempted company does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies;  
<br><br>
 

 --an exempted company’s register of members is not open to inspection;  

 <br><br>

 --an exempted company does not have to hold an annual general meeting;  

 <br><br>

 --an exempted company may issue no par value, negotiable or bearer shares;  

 <br><br>

 --an exempted company may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first instance);  

 <br><br>

 --an exempted company may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands;  

 <br><br>

 --an exempted company may register as a limited duration company; and  
<br><br>
 

 --an exempted company may register as a segregated portfolio company.  
<br><br>
“Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on the shares of the company. 
<br><br>
Upon the completion of this offering, we will be subject to reporting and other informational requirements of the Exchange Act, as applicable to foreign private issuers. Except as otherwise disclosed in this prospectus, we currently intend to comply with the New York Stock Exchange rules or Nasdaq Listing Rules in lieu of following home country practice after the completion of this offering. The New York Stock Exchange rules or Nasdaq Listing Rules require that every company listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Global Market hold an annual general meeting of shareholders. In addition, our articles allow directors to call an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders pursuant to the procedures set forth therein. 
<br><br>
Register of Members 
<br><br>
Under the Cayman Companies Law, we must keep a register of members and there should be entered 
<br><br>
therein: 
<br><br>
 

 --the names and addresses of our members, a statement of the shares held by each member, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid, on the shares of each member;  
<br><br>

 --the date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and  

 <br><br>

 --the date on which any person ceased to be a member.  
<br><br>
Under Cayman Companies Law, the register of members of our company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (that is, the register of members will raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members is deemed as a matter of Cayman Companies Law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members. Upon the completion of this offering, the register of members will be immediately updated to record and give effect to the issuance of shares by us to the Depositary (or its nominee) as the depositary. Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members will be deemed to have legal title to the shares set against their name. 
<br><br>
If the name of any person is incorrectly entered in or omitted from our register of members, or if there is any default or unnecessary delay in entering on the register the fact of any person having ceased to be a member of our company, the person or member aggrieved (or any member of our company or our company itself) may apply to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands for an order that the register be rectified, and the Court may either refuse such application or it may, if satisfied of the justice of the case, make an order for the rectification of the register. 
<br><br>
Differences in Corporate Law 
<br><br>
The Cayman Companies Law is derived, to a large extent, from the older Companies Acts of England and Wales but does not follow recent United Kingdom statutory enactments, and accordingly there are significant differences between the Cayman Companies Law and the current Companies Act of England. In addition, the Cayman Companies Law differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of certain significant differences between the provisions of the Cayman Companies Law applicable to us and the comparable laws applicable to companies incorporated in the State of Delaware in the United States. 
<br><br>
Mergers and Similar Arrangements 
<br><br>
The Cayman Companies Law permits mergers and consolidations between Cayman Islands companies and between Cayman Islands companies and non-Cayman Islands companies. For these purposes, (a) “merger” means the merging of two or more constituent companies and the vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in one of such companies as the surviving company, and (b) a “consolidation” means the combination of two or more constituent companies into a consolidated company and the vesting of the undertaking, property and liabilities of such companies to the consolidated company. In order to effect such a merger or consolidation, the directors of each constituent company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation, which must then be authorized by (a) a special resolution of the shareholders of each constituent company, and (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association. The plan must be filed with the Registrar of Companies together with a declaration as to the solvency of the consolidated or surviving company, a list of the assets and liabilities of each constituent company and an undertaking that a copy of the certificate of merger or consolidation will be given to the members and creditors of each constituent company and that notification of the merger or consolidation will be published in the Cayman Islands Gazette. Court approval is not required for a merger or consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures. 
<br><br>
Our articles will provide that, in addition to the requirements described in the preceding paragraph, if the rights of the Alibaba Partnership as described under “― Nomination, Election and Removal of Directors” are adversely impacted by the merger, the affirmative vote of at least 95% of our shareholders voting at a meeting of our shareholders shall be required. 
<br><br>
A merger between a Cayman parent company and its Cayman subsidiary or subsidiaries does not require authorization by a resolution of shareholders. For this purpose a subsidiary is a company of which at least 90% of the issued shares entitled to vote are owned by the parent company. 
<br><br>
The consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest of a constituent company is required unless this requirement is waived by a court in the Cayman Islands. 
<br><br>
Except in certain limited circumstances, a dissenting shareholder of a Cayman Islands constituent company is entitled to payment of the fair value of his or her shares upon dissenting from a merger or consolidation. The exercise of such dissenter rights will preclude the exercise by the dissenting shareholder of any other rights to which he or she might otherwise be entitled by virtue of holding shares, except for the right to seek relief on the grounds that the merger or consolidation is void or unlawful. 
<br><br>
In addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, and who must, in addition, represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that: 

 <br><br>

 --the statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met;  

 <br><br>

 --the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide without coercion of the minority to promote interests adverse to those of the class;  

 <br><br>

 --the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of his interest; and  

 <br><br>

 --the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Cayman Companies Law.  
<br><br>
When a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90% of the shares affected within four months the offeror may, within a two-month period commencing on the expiration of such four month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed in the case of an offer which has been so approved unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or collusion. 

 <br><br>
If an arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved, or if a takeover offer is made and accepted, a dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights, which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of Delaware corporations, providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares. 
<br><br>
Shareholders’ Suits 
<br><br>
In principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff to sue for a wrong done to us as a company and as a general rule, a derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder. However, based on English law authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority in the Cayman Islands, the Cayman Islands courts can be expected to follow and apply the common law principles (namely the rule in Foss v. Harbottle and the exceptions thereto) so that a non-controlling shareholder may be permitted to commence a class action against or derivative actions in the name of the company to challenge: 
<br><br>
 

 --an act which is illegal or ultra vires with respect to the company and is therefore incapable of ratification by the shareholders;  
<br><br>
 

 --an act which, although not ultra vires, requires authorization by a qualified (or special) majority (that is, more than a simple majority) which has not been obtained; and  
<br><br>
 

 --an act which constitutes a “fraud on the minority” where the wrongdoers are themselves in control of the company.  
<br><br>
Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability 
<br><br>
The Cayman Companies Law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our articles provide that we shall indemnify our officers and directors against all actions, proceedings, costs, charges, expenses, losses, damages or liabilities incurred or sustained by such directors or officer, other than by reason of such person’s dishonesty, willful default or fraud, in or about the conduct of our company’s business or affairs (including as a result of any mistake of judgment) or in the execution or discharge of his duties, powers, authorities or discretions, including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, any costs, expenses, losses or liabilities incurred by such director or officer in defending (whether successfully or otherwise) any civil proceedings concerning our company or its affairs in any court whether in the Cayman Islands or elsewhere. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation. In addition, we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that will provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in our articles. 
<br><br>
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. 
<br><br>
Anti-Takeover Provisions in Our Articles 
<br><br>
Some provisions of our articles may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that provide that any merger to which we are a party will require an affirmative vote of 95% of our shareholders voting at a meeting of our shareholders in the event such merger would adversely affect the Alibaba Partnership’s rights to nominate or appoint persons to serve as directors on our board, limitations on shareholder rights to nominate or remove directors, as well as provisions that authorize our board of directors to issue preference shares in one or more series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such preference shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders. 
<br><br>
Under the Cayman Companies Law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our articles, as amended and restated from time to time, for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our company and for a proper purpose. 
<br><br>

<a href= "link01.html">中国崛起的四个问题</a><br><br>
Directors’ Fiduciary Duties  基于信用的，信托的，受信托的
<br><br>
Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He or she must not use his or her corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation. 
<br><br>
As a matter of Cayman law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore he owes the following duties to the company ― a duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a profit based on his or her position as director (unless the company permits him to do so), a duty not to put himself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her duty to a third party, and a duty to exercise powers for the purpose for which such powers were intended. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands. 
<br><br>
Shareholder Proposals 
<br><br>
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. The Delaware General Corporation Law does not provide shareholders an express right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, but in keeping with common law, Delaware corporations generally afford shareholders an opportunity to make proposals and nominations provided that they comply with the notice provisions in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings. 
<br><br>
The Cayman Companies Law provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting, and does not provide shareholders with any right to put any proposal before a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in a company’s articles of association. Our articles allow our shareholders holding not less than one-third of the voting rights entitled to vote at general meetings to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, in which case our board is obliged to convene an extraordinary general meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting. However, our shareholders may propose only ordinary resolutions to be put to a vote at such meetings and shall have no right to propose resolutions with respect to the election, appointment or removal of directors. Our articles provide no other right to put any proposals before annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings. As a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not obligated by law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings. However, our corporate governance guidelines require us to call such meetings every year. 
<br><br>
Cumulative Voting 
<br><br>
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting power with respect to electing such director. As permitted under the Cayman Companies Law, our articles do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation. 
<br><br>
Removal of Directors 
<br><br>
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our articles, other than SoftBank’s right to remove the director nominated by it, our shareholders generally do not have the right to remove directors. Directors will be removed from office automatically if, among other things, the director (1) dies or becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors generally; or (2) is found of unsound mind; or (3) resigns his office by notice in writing to our company. In addition, the directors nominated or appointed by the Alibaba Partnership are subject to removal, with or without cause, only by the Alibaba Partnership and the director nominated or appointed by SoftBank will be subject to removal, with or without cause, only by SoftBank. Any director nominated or appointed by the nominating and corporate governance committee may be removed for cause by a vote of the majority of the board of directors upon the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee. 
<br><br>

The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware public corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws that is approved by its shareholders, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting stock or who or which is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and owned 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock within the past three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors. 
<br><br>
The Cayman Companies Law has no comparable statute. As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware business combination statute. However, although the Cayman Companies Law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders, it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and for a proper corporate purpose and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders. 
<br><br>
Dissolution; Winding Up 
<br><br>
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board of directors. 
<br><br>
Under the Cayman Companies Law and our articles, our company may be wound up only upon resolution of shareholders holding 100% of the total voting rights entitled to vote or if the winding up is initiated by our board of directors, by either a special resolution of our members or, if our company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of our members. In addition, a company may be wound up by an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands. The court has authority to order winding up in a number of specified circumstances including where it is, in the opinion of the court, just and equitable to do so. 
<br><br>
Variation of Rights of Shares 
<br><br>
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under the Cayman Companies Law and our articles, if our share capital is divided into more than one class of shares, we may vary the rights attached to any class only with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-fourths of the shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. 
<br><br>
<a href= "link04.html">全面推进依法治国</a><br><br>
Amendment of Governing Documents 
<br><br>
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s certificate of incorporation may be amended only if adopted and declared advisable by the board of directors and approved by a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, and the bylaws may be amended with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote and may, if so provided in the certificate of incorporation, also be amended by the board of directors. Under the Cayman Companies Law, our articles may only be amended by special resolution of our shareholders, and in the case of amendments of certain provisions (as described in “― Ordinary Shares ― Voting Rights” above), such special resolution shall require the affirmative vote of at least 95% of the votes cast by shareholders at a meeting of the shareholders. 
<br><br>
Rights of Non-Resident or Foreign Shareholders 
<br><br>
There are no limitations imposed by our articles on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in our articles governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed. 
<br><br>
Directors’ Power to Issue Shares 
<br><br>
Under our articles, our board of directors is empowered to issue or allot shares or grant options, restricted shares, RSUs, share appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, warrants and analogous equity-based rights with or without preferred, deferred, qualified or other special rights or restrictions. In particular, pursuant to our articles, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the shareholders, to issue up to              preferred shares in one or more series and to fix the designations, powers, preferences, privileges, and relative participating, optional or special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions therefrom, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of our ordinary shares. Our board of directors, without shareholder approval, may issue preferred shares with voting, conversion or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of our ordinary shares. Subject to the directors’ duty of acting in the best interest of our company, preferred shares can be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of us or make removal of management more difficult. Additionally, the issuance of preferred shares may have the effect of decreasing the market price of the ordinary shares, and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of ordinary shares. 
<br><br>
Inspection of Books and Records 
<br><br>
Holders of our ordinary shares will have no general right under the Cayman Companies Law to inspect or obtain copies of our list of shareholders or our corporate records. However, we will provide our shareholders with annual audited financial statements. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”

	<b><a name="T29">History of Securities Issuances </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The following is a summary of our securities issuances since April 1, 2011. 
<br><br>
Ordinary Shares <br><br>

On August 27, 2012, we entered into a share purchase and investor rights agreement with certain investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 167,741,936 ordinary shares at a subscription price of US$15.50 per share to such investors at an aggregate consideration of US$2.6 billion on September 18, 2012. 
<br><br>
Pursuant to the share purchase and investor rights agreement, each of these investors also agrees with Jack Ma that it will vote its ordinary shares so acquired in a manner consistent with Jack or his designee’s request at any shareholders meeting with respect to certain substantial shareholder proposals, including approving transactions or proposals, the election or removal of any director, or the amendment of any provision of our articles of association relating to the election or removal of any director or the composition or powers of our board of directors, in each case, resulting in any substantial shareholder gaining the right to change our management and/or policies. For purposes of this voting provision, “substantial shareholder” is defined to mean any non-management shareholder that owns, or a group of non-management shareholders acting in concert that own, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of our outstanding ordinary shares either (a) at the time such substantial shareholder proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise notified to us, any of the directors or any of the holders of 3% or more of our outstanding ordinary shares or (b) on the record date of the shareholders meeting related to such substantial shareholder proposal. The voting provisions under the share purchase and investor rights agreement will be terminated upon the completion of this offering. 
<br><br>
Convertible Preference Shares 
<br><br>
On August 31, 2012 and October 15, 2012, we entered into convertible preference share purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which such investors agreed to subscribe for an aggregate of 1,688,000 series A convertible preference shares in our company, or the convertible preference shares, for an aggregate consideration of US$1,688 million. The convertible preference shares were issued in two tranches of 1,338,000 and 350,000 convertible preference shares on September 18, 2012 and on October 16, 2012, respectively. We used the proceeds from the first tranche to partially finance our repurchase of 523,000,000 ordinary shares in our company from Yahoo in September 2012. We used the proceeds from the second tranche for general corporate purposes. Assuming an initial conversion price of US$18.50 per ordinary share (which is the conversion price currently in effect), the convertible preference shares will convert into an aggregate 91,243,243 of our ordinary shares concurrently with the completion of this offering. 
<br><br>
These convertible preference shares are redeemable at an amount equal to their liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends at our option and at any time subsequent to the first anniversary of the issue date if certain conditions are met. Such shares are mandatorily redeemable on the fifth anniversary of the issue date unless previously redeemed or converted. The holders of the convertible preference shares are entitled to semi-annual dividends at a pre-determined rate until such shares are redeemed as follows: 2.0% per annum prior to the second anniversary of the issuance date, 5.0% per annum commencing on the second anniversary of the issuance date until the mandatory redemption date, and 8.0% per annum thereafter until the convertible preference shares are redeemed or converted into ordinary shares. The convertible preference shares are convertible at the holder’s option at any time at an initial conversion price of US$18.50 per ordinary share subject to certain adjustments, and shall be mandatorily converted concurrently with the closing of a qualified IPO as defined in the convertible preference share purchase agreement (which includes this offering). The holders of such preference shares have no voting rights and do not have any obligation to enter into any lock-up agreements with us or the underwriters in connection with this offering. 
<br><br>
Redeemable Preference Shares 
<br><br>
We issued 800,000 preference shares in our company to Yahoo in September 2012 for a total consideration of US$800 million. The consideration paid for the redeemable preference shares was used by us to partially fund the repurchase of 523,000,000 ordinary shares in our company from Yahoo in September 2012. We subsequently redeemed the Yahoo preference shares in May 2013 using funds borrowed under our loan facility. See “Related Party Transactions ― Transactions and Agreements with Yahoo and SoftBank ― Our Repurchase of Ordinary Shares from Yahoo” for more information. As the holder of the Yahoo preference shares, Yahoo was entitled to cumulative, semi-annual dividends at a rate of up to 10% per annum, subject to certain adjustments tied to the credit assessment of us, with at least 3% per annum payable in cash on pre-determined dividend payment dates and the remaining amount accrued to the liquidation preference. 
<br><br>
Share Options, RSUs, Restricted Shares and Other Rights Granted 
<br><br>
We have granted options covering an aggregate of 9,808,000 ordinary shares, 58,030,108 ordinary share subject to RSUs, and 20,284,816 restricted shares to certain directors, employees, consultants and other grantees, including certain employees of our related companies or affiliates under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. We granted an aggregate of 1,203,262 ordinary share subject to RSUs and 2,274,804 restricted shares in connection with certain investments and acquisitions we made in the fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014. We also granted 100,000 ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options, 1,135,486 ordinary share subject to RSUs and 5,824,000 restricted shares to employee shareholders of certain entities we acquired for entering into non-compete covenants with us. We issued 18,000,000 ordinary shares to special purpose vehicles in July 2013 relating to the Partner Capital Investment Plan. 
<br><br>
Registration Rights 
<br><br>
Pursuant to the amended and restated registration rights agreement entered into on September 18, 2012, we have granted certain registration rights to certain major shareholders, including SoftBank and Yahoo, among others, and holders specified by us from time to time, of our registrable securities, which include our ordinary shares and ordinary shares issued as a dividend or other distribution therefor. Set forth below is a description of the registration rights. 
<br><br>
Demand registration rights. Subject to any applicable lock-up agreement they may enter into, at any time after the completion of our initial public offering, including this offering, SoftBank, its affiliates and Yahoo have the right to demand that we file a registration statement to enable the sale of their registrable securities. We have the right to defer the filing of a registration statement up to 90 days if our board of directors determines in good faith that such registration and offering would be seriously detrimental to us and our shareholders, provided that we may not utilize this right more than twice in any 12-month period and during such 90-day period, we shall not file a registration statement with respect to the public offering of our securities. 
<br><br>
Piggyback registration rights. If we initiate any underwritten offering, we shall notify all holders of registrable securities and afford them an opportunity to include in the registration all or any part of their registrable securities that each such holder may request to be registered, provided that we may engage in one such underwritten offering initiated by us without providing the holders with such rights. 
<br><br>
Form S-3 or F-3 registration. Holders of our registrable securities have the right to request that we file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form F-3 when we are eligible to use such form. We also have the right to postpone a registration pursuant to this request up to 90 days if our board of directors determines in good faith that it would be seriously detrimental to us for such registration statement to be filed, provided that we may not file a registration statement with respect to the public offering of our securities during such 90-day period. We may not utilize this right more than twice in any 12-month period. 
<br><br>
Expenses of registration. We will pay all expenses (other than underwriting discounts and commissions) in connection with the demand registration, Form S-3 or Form F-3 registration and piggyback registration including, among others, all registration and filing fees, printers’ and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for us, reasonable fees and disbursements of a single special counsel for the holders. 
<br><br>
Limitation on granting of further registration rights. We shall not, without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding, enter into any agreement with the holder of any securities that would grant such holder demand registration rights senior to, or in parity with, those granted to the holders under the amended and restated registration rights agreement. 
<br><br>
Lock-up agreements. Subject to certain conditions and waivers, at our request or the request of the underwriters of an underwritten offering, the holders of our registrable securities will agree not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose any of their registrable securities for up to 180 days from the listing date of our shares in such underwritten offering, and Yahoo and SoftBank will agree not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose any of their respective registrable securities for up to one year from the listing date of our ordinary shares (including shares represented by ADSs) in our initial public offering subject to certain exceptions, provided that Alibaba Group Holding Limited, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai are subject to the same restrictions. 
<br><br>
Other Voting Arrangements 
<br><br>
Pursuant to three voting agreements between Dawn VA Ltd., an entity owned by two of our senior management members, including Jonathan Lu, our chief executive officer, who holds a 33% equity interest in such entity, and one of the members of senior management of our related company, and certain investors dated September 22, 2011 and one voting agreement between Dawn VA Ltd. and one investor dated December 29, 2011 in connection with the sales of 149,109,473 of our ordinary shares by certain of our employees and others, including Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, the investors agreed that Dawn VA Ltd. as the proxyholder, shall be entitled to vote the ordinary shares acquired by such investors, in its sole discretion, on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, provided that Dawn VA Ltd. shall be entitled to vote such acquired shares against certain matters relating to any initial public offering of a subsidiary that would have a material adverse effect on the success of the initial public offering of our company. These voting agreements will be terminated upon the completion of this offering. 
<br><br>
Our employees, consultants and other grantees who acquired our ordinary shares upon exercise of the options granted by us to them under our equity incentive plans have given proxies to Jack Ma (or failing him, Joe Tsai) to vote their ordinary shares at shareholders meetings. These proxies will be terminated upon the completion of this offering. 
<br><br>
We, Jack Ma, Joe Tsai, SoftBank and Yahoo expect to enter into a voting agreement effective upon the completion of this offering, pursuant to which they will agree to certain voting arrangements with respect to, among other things, voting arrangements in favor of the election of the Alibaba Partnership’s director nominees and the SoftBank director nominee at each annual general shareholders meeting. See “Related Party Transactions ― Transactions and Agreements with Yahoo and SoftBank ― Voting Agreement.”

	<b><a name="T30">DESCRIPTION OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
American Depositary Shares 
<br><br>
 -              , as depositary, will register and deliver the ADSs. Each ADS will represent an ownership interest in             ordinary shares deposited with the office in Hong Kong of             , as custodian for the depositary. Each ADS will also represent an ownership interest in any other securities, cash or other property which may be held by the depositary. The depositary’s corporate trust office at which the ADSs will be administered is located at . The principal executive office of the depositary is located at             . 
<br><br>
The Direct Registration System, or DRS, is a system administered by The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, pursuant to which the depositary may register the ownership of uncertificated ADSs, which ownership shall be evidenced by periodic statements issued by the depositary to the ADS holders entitled thereto. 
<br><br>
We will not treat ADS holders as our shareholders and accordingly, you, as an ADS holder, will not have a shareholder’s rights. Cayman Islands law governs shareholders’ rights. The depositary will be the holder of the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. As a holder of ADSs, you will have an ADS holder’s rights. A deposit agreement among us, the depositary and the beneficial owners of ADSs sets out ADS holders’ rights as well as the rights and obligations of the depositary. The laws of the State of New York govern the deposit agreement and the ADSs. 
<br><br>
The following is a summary of the material provisions of the deposit agreement. For more complete information, you should read the entire deposit agreement and the form of American Depositary Receipt. For directions on how to obtain copies of those documents, see “Where You Can Find More Information.” 
<br><br>
Holding the ADSs 
<br><br>
How will you hold your ADSs? 
<br><br>
You may hold ADSs either (1) directly (a) by having an American Depositary Receipt, or ADR, which is a certificate evidencing a specific number of ADSs, registered in your name, or (b) by holding ADSs in the DRS, or (2) indirectly through your broker or other financial institution. If you hold ADSs directly, you are an ADS holder. This description assumes you hold your ADSs directly. If you hold ADSs indirectly, you must rely on the procedures of your broker or other financial institution to assert the rights of ADS holders described in this section. You should consult with your broker or financial institution to find out what those procedures are. 
<br><br>
Dividends and Other Distributions 
<br><br>
How will you receive dividends and other distributions on our ordinary shares? 
<br><br>
The depositary has agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on ordinary shares or other deposited securities, after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of ordinary shares your ADSs represent as of the record date (which will be as close as practicable to the record date for our ordinary shares) set by the depositary with respect to the ADSs. 
<br><br>
 

 --Cash. The depositary will convert any cash dividend or other cash distribution we pay on the ordinary shares or any net proceeds from the sale of any ordinary shares, rights, securities or other entitlements into U.S. dollars if it may do so on a reasonable basis, and may transfer the U.S. dollars to the United States. If that is not possible or lawful or if any government approval is needed and cannot be obtained, the deposit agreement allows the depositary to distribute the foreign currency only to those ADS holders to whom it is possible to do so. It will hold the foreign currency it cannot convert for the account of the ADS holders who have not been paid. It will not invest the foreign currency and it will not be liable for any interest. <br><br> 
Before making a distribution, any taxes or other governmental charges, together with fees and expenses of the depositary that must be paid will be deducted. See “Taxation.” The depositary will distribute only whole U.S. dollars and cents and will round fractional cents to the nearest whole cent. If the exchange rates fluctuate during a time when the depositary cannot convert the foreign currency, you may lose some or all of the value of the distribution. 
<br><br>
 

 --Shares. The depositary may, upon our timely instruction, distribute additional ADSs representing any ordinary shares we distribute as a dividend or free distribution to the extent reasonably practicable and permissible under law. The depositary will only distribute whole ADSs. It will try to sell ordinary shares which would require it to deliver a fractional ADS and distribute the net proceeds in the same way as it does with cash. If the depositary does not distribute additional ADSs, the outstanding ADSs will also represent the new ordinary shares. The depositary may sell a portion of the distributed ordinary shares sufficient to pay its fees and expenses in connection with that distribution.  
<br><br>
 

 --Elective distributions in cash or shares. If we offer holders of our ordinary shares the option to receive dividends in either cash or shares, the depositary, after consultation with us and having received timely notice of such elective distribution by us, has discretion to determine to what extent such elective distribution will be made available to you as a holder of the ADSs. We must first instruct the depositary to make such elective distribution available to you and furnish it with satisfactory evidence that it is legal to do so. The depositary could decide it is not legal or reasonably practical to make such elective distribution available to you, or it could decide that it is only legal or reasonably practical to make such elective distribution available to some but not all holders of the ADSs. In such case, the depositary shall, on the basis of the same determination as is made in respect of the ordinary shares for which no election is made, distribute either cash in the same way as it does in a cash distribution, or additional ADSs representing ordinary shares in the same way as it does in a share distribution. The depositary is not obligated to make available to you a method to receive the elective dividend in shares rather than in ADSs. There can be no assurance that you will be given the opportunity to receive elective distributions on the same terms and conditions as the holders of ordinary shares.  
<br><br>
 

 --Rights to purchase additional shares. If we offer holders of our ordinary shares any rights to subscribe for additional shares or any other rights, the depositary may, after consultation with us and having received timely notice of such distribution by us, make these rights available to you. We must first instruct the depositary to make such rights available to you and furnish the depositary with satisfactory evidence that it is legal to do so. If the depositary decides it is not legal and practical to make the rights available but that it is practical to sell the rights, the depositary will use reasonable efforts to sell the rights and distribute the net proceeds in the same way as it does with cash. The depositary will allow rights that are not distributed or sold to lapse. In that case, you will receive no value for them.  
<br><br>
If the depositary makes rights available to you, it will exercise the rights and purchase the shares on your behalf. The depositary will then deposit the shares and deliver ADSs to you. It will only exercise rights if you pay it the exercise price and any other charges the rights require you to pay. 
<br><br>
U.S. securities laws may restrict transfers and cancellation of the ADSs represented by shares purchased upon exercise of rights. For example, you may not be able to trade these ADSs freely in the United States. In this case, the depositary may deliver restricted depositary shares that have the same terms as the ADSs described in this section except for changes needed to put the necessary restrictions in place. 
<br><br>
 

 --Other distributions. Subject to receipt of timely notice from us with the request to make any such distribution available to you, and provided the depositary has determined such distribution is lawful and reasonably practicable and feasible and in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement, the depositary will send to you anything else we distribute on deposited securities by any means it thinks is legal, fair and practical. If it cannot make the distribution in that way, the depositary has a choice: it may decide to sell what we distributed and distribute the net proceeds in the same way as it does with  cash; or, it may decide to hold what we distributed, in which case ADSs will also represent the newly distributed property. However, the depositary is not required to distribute any securities (other than ADSs) to you unless it receives satisfactory evidence from us that it is legal to make that distribution. The depositary may sell a portion of the distributed securities or property sufficient to pay its fees and expenses in connection with that distribution. 
 
<br><br>
The depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any ADS holders. We have no obligation to register ADSs, shares, rights or other securities under the Securities Act in order to make a distribution to ADS holders. We also have no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of ADSs, shares, rights or anything else to ADS holders. This means that you may not receive the distributions we make on our shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical for us to make them available to you. 
<br><br>
Retter2012，我们提供“更快的速度”和“更好的内容”。<br><br>
<a href="http://www.retter2012.com/">Retter is Better</a>, WE Create and Deliver Real Value!<br><br>
Deposit, Withdrawal and Cancellation 
<br><br>
How are ADSs issued? 
<br><br>
The depositary will deliver ADSs if you or your broker deposit ordinary shares or evidence of rights to receive ordinary shares with the custodian. Upon payment of its fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary will register the appropriate number of ADSs in the names you request and will deliver the ADSs to or upon the order of the person or persons entitled thereto. 
<br><br>
How do ADS holders cancel an ADS? 
<br><br>
You may turn in your ADSs at the depositary’s corporate trust office or by providing appropriate instructions to your broker. Upon payment of its fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary will deliver the ordinary shares and any other deposited securities underlying the ADSs to you or a person you designate at the office of the custodian. Or, at your request, risk and expense, the depositary will deliver the deposited securities at its corporate trust office, if feasible. 
<br><br>
How do ADS holders interchange between certificated ADSs and uncertificated ADSs? 
<br><br>
You may surrender your ADR to the depositary for the purpose of exchanging your ADR for uncertificated ADSs. The depositary will cancel that ADR and will send you a statement confirming that you are the owner of uncertificated ADSs. Alternatively, upon receipt by the depositary of a proper instruction from a holder of uncertificated ADSs requesting the exchange of uncertificated ADSs for ADRs, the depositary will execute and deliver to you an ADR evidencing those ADSs. 
<br><br>
Voting Rights 
<br><br>
How do you vote? 
<br><br>
You may instruct the depositary to vote the deposited securities underlying your ADSs. Otherwise, you will not be able to exercise your right to vote unless you withdraw the ordinary shares your ADSs represent. However, you may not know about the meeting sufficiently in advance to withdraw the ordinary shares. 
<br><br>
If we ask for your instructions, upon timely notice from us, the depositary will notify you of the upcoming vote and arrange to deliver our voting materials to you. The materials will (1) describe the matters to be voted on and (2) explain how you may instruct the depositary to vote the ordinary shares or other deposited securities underlying your ADSs as you direct, including an express indication that such instruction may be given or deemed given in accordance with the second to last sentence of this paragraph if no instruction is received, to the depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us. For instructions to be valid, the depositary must receive them on or before the date specified. The depositary will try, as far as practical, subject to the laws of the Cayman Islands and the provisions of our constitutive documents, to vote or to have its agents vote the ordinary shares or other deposited securities as you instruct. The depositary will only vote or attempt to vote as you instruct. If we timely requested the depositary to solicit your instructions but no instructions are received by the depositary from an owner with respect to any of the deposited securities represented by the ADSs of that owner on or before the date established by the depositary for such purpose, the depositary shall deem that owner to have instructed the depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us with respect to such deposited securities, and the depositary shall give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us to vote such deposited securities. However, no such instruction shall be deemed given and no such discretionary proxy shall be given with respect to any matter if we inform the depositary we do not wish such proxy given, substantial opposition exists or the matter materially and adversely affects the rights of holders of our ordinary shares. 
<br><br>
We cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. In addition, the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions. This means that you may not be able to exercise your right to vote and there may be nothing you can do if the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs are not voted as you requested. <br><br>

In order to give you a reasonable opportunity to instruct the depositary as to the exercise of voting rights relating to deposited securities, if we request the depositary to act, we will try to give the depositary notice of any such meeting and details concerning the matters to be voted upon sufficiently in advance of the meeting date.

	<b><a name="T31">Fees and Expenses</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
<a href= "pic88.html">Fees and Expenses </a><br><br>
_             , as depositary, has agreed to reimburse us for a portion of certain expenses we incur that are related to establishment and maintenance of the ADR program, including investor relations expenses. There are limits on the amount of expenses for which the depositary will reimburse us, but the amount of reimbursement available to us is not related to the amounts of fees the depositary collects from investors. Furthermore, the depositary has agreed to reimburse us certain fees payable to the depositary by holders of ADSs. Neither the depositary nor we can determine the exact amount to be made available to us because (i) the number of ADSs that will be issued and outstanding, (ii) the level of service fees to be charged to holders of ADSs and (iii) our reimbursable expenses related to the program are not known at this time. 
<br><br>
The depositary collects its fees for issuance and cancellation of ADSs directly from investors depositing shares or surrendering ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them. The depositary collects fees for making distributions to investors by deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. The depositary may collect its annual fee for depositary services by deduction from cash distributions, by directly billing investors, or by charging the book-entry system accounts of participants acting for them. The depositary may generally refuse to provide fee-attracting services until its fees for those services are paid. 
<br><br>
Payment of Taxes 
<br><br>
You will be responsible for any taxes or other governmental charges payable on your ADSs or on the deposited securities represented by any of your ADSs. The depositary may refuse to register any transfer of your ADSs or allow you to withdraw the deposited securities represented by your ADSs until such taxes or other charges are paid. It may apply payments owed to you or sell deposited securities represented by your ADSs to pay any taxes owed and you will remain liable for any deficiency. If the depositary sells deposited securities, it will, if appropriate, reduce the number of ADSs to reflect the sale and pay to you any net proceeds, or send to you any property, remaining after it has paid the taxes. You agree to indemnify us, the depositary, the custodian and each of our and their respective agents, directors, employees and affiliates for, and hold each of them harmless from, any claims with respect to taxes (including applicable interest and penalties thereon) arising from any tax benefit obtained for you.

	<b><a name="T32">Amendment and Termination </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
How may the deposit agreement be amended? <br><br>

We may agree with the depositary to amend the deposit agreement and the form of ADR without your consent for any reason. If an amendment adds or increases fees or charges, except for taxes and other governmental charges or expenses of the depositary for registration fees, facsimile costs, delivery charges or similar items, including expenses incurred in connection with foreign exchange control regulations and other charges specifically payable by ADS holders under the deposit agreement, or materially prejudices a substantial existing right of ADS holders, it will not become effective for outstanding ADSs until 30 days after the depositary notifies ADS holders of the amendment. At the time an amendment becomes effective, you are considered, by continuing to hold your ADSs, to agree to the amendment and to be bound by the ADRs and the deposit agreement as amended. <br><br>

How may the deposit agreement be terminated? <br><br>

The depositary will terminate the deposit agreement if we ask it to do so, in which case the depositary will give notice to you at least 90 days prior to termination. The depositary may also terminate the deposit agreement if the depositary has told us that it would like to resign and we have not appointed a new depositary within 90 days. In such case, the depositary must notify you at least 30 days before termination. <br><br>

After termination, the depositary and its agents will do the following under the deposit agreement but nothing else: collect distributions on the deposited securities, sell rights and other property, and deliver ordinary shares and other deposited securities upon cancellation of ADSs after payment of any fees, charges, taxes or other governmental charges. Six months or more after termination, the depositary may sell any remaining deposited securities by public or private sale. After that, the depositary will hold the money it received on the sale, as well as any other cash it is holding under the deposit agreement, for the pro rata benefit of the ADS holders that have not surrendered their ADSs. It will not invest the money and has no liability for interest. The depositary’s only obligations will be to account for the money and other cash. After termination, our only obligations will be to indemnify the depositary and to pay fees and expenses of the depositary that we agreed to pay. <br><br>

Books of Depositary <br><br>

The depositary will maintain ADS holder records at its depositary office. You may inspect such records at such office during regular business hours but solely for the purpose of communicating with other holders in the interest of business matters relating to the ADSs and the deposit agreement. 
<br><br>
The depositary will maintain facilities in New York to record and process the issuance, cancellation, combination, split-up and transfer of ADRs. <br><br>

These facilities may be closed from time to time, to the extent not prohibited by law or if any such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the depositary or us, in good faith, at any time or from time to time because of any requirement of law, any government or governmental body or commission or any securities exchange on which the ADRs or ADSs are listed, or under any provision of the deposit agreement or provisions of, or governing, the deposited securities, or any meeting of our shareholders or for any other reason. <br><br>

In the deposit agreement, we and the depositary agree to indemnify each other under certain circumstances. 
<br><br>
Requirements for Depositary Actions <br><br>

Before the depositary will issue, deliver or register a transfer of an ADS, make a distribution on an ADS, or permit withdrawal of ordinary shares, the depositary may require: 
<br><br>
 

--payment of stock transfer or other taxes or other governmental charges and transfer or registration fees charged by third parties for the transfer of any ordinary shares or other deposited securities and payment of the applicable fees, expenses and charges of the depositary;  

 <br><br>

--satisfactory proof of the identity and genuineness of any signature or other information it deems necessary; and  
<br><br>
 

--compliance with regulations it may establish, from time to time, consistent with the deposit agreement, including presentation of transfer documents.  
<br><br>
The depositary may refuse to issue and deliver ADSs or register transfers of ADSs generally when the register of the depositary or our transfer books are closed or at any time if the depositary or we think it is necessary or advisable to do so. 
<br><br>
Your Right to Receive the Shares Underlying Your ADSs 
<br><br>
You have the right to cancel your ADSs and withdraw the underlying ordinary shares at any time except: 
<br><br>
 

--when temporary delays arise because: (1) the depositary has closed its transfer books or we have closed our transfer books; (2) the transfer of ordinary shares is blocked to permit voting at a shareholders’ meeting; or (3) we are paying a dividend on our ordinary shares;  

 <br><br>

--when you owe money to pay fees, taxes and similar charges; or  
<br><br>
 

--when it is necessary to prohibit withdrawals in order to comply with any laws or governmental regulations that apply to ADSs or to the withdrawal of ordinary shares or other deposited securities.  
<br><br>
This right of withdrawal may not be limited by any other provision of the deposit agreement. 
<br><br>
Pre-release of ADSs 
<br><br>
The deposit agreement permits the depositary to deliver ADSs before deposit of the underlying ordinary shares. This is called a pre-release of the ADSs. The depositary may also deliver ordinary shares upon cancellation of pre-released ADSs (even if the ADSs are cancelled before the pre-release transaction has been closed out). A pre-release is closed out as soon as the underlying ordinary shares are delivered to the depositary. The depositary may receive ADSs instead of ordinary shares to close out a pre-release. The depositary may pre-release ADSs only under the following conditions: (1) before or at the time of the pre-release, the person to whom the pre-release is being made represents to the depositary in writing that it or its customer (a) owns the ordinary shares or ADSs to be deposited, (b) assigns all beneficial rights, title and interest in such ordinary shares or ADSs to the depositary for the benefit of the owners, (c) will not take any action with respect to such ordinary shares or ADSs that is inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, (d) indicates the depositary as owner of such ordinary shares or ADSs in its records, and (e) unconditionally guarantees to deliver such ordinary shares or ADSs to the depositary or the custodian, as the case may be; (2) the pre-release is fully collateralized with cash or other collateral that the depositary considers appropriate; and (3) the depositary must be able to close out the pre-release on not more than five business days’ notice. Each pre-release is subject to further indemnities and credit regulations as the depositary considers appropriate. In addition, the depositary will limit the number of ADSs that may be outstanding at any time as a result of pre-release, although the depositary may disregard the limit from time to time, if it thinks it is appropriate to do so, including (1) due to a decrease in the aggregate number of ADSs outstanding that causes existing pre-release transactions to temporarily exceed the limit stated above or (2) where otherwise required by market conditions. 
<br><br>
Direct Registration System 
<br><br>
In the deposit agreement, all parties to the deposit agreement acknowledge that the DRS and Profile Modification System, or Profile, will apply to uncertificated ADSs upon acceptance thereof to DRS by DTC. DRS is the system administered by DTC pursuant to which the depositary may register the ownership of uncertificated ADSs, which ownership shall be evidenced by periodic statements issued by the depositary to the ADS holders entitled thereto. Profile is a required feature of DRS which allows a DTC participant, claiming to act on behalf of an ADS holder, to direct the depositary to register a transfer of those ADSs to DTC or its nominee and to deliver those ADSs to the DTC account of that DTC participant without receipt by the depositary of prior authorization from the ADS holder to register such transfer. 
<br><br>
In connection with and in accordance with the arrangements and procedures relating to DRS/Profile, the parties to the deposit agreement understand that the depositary will not verify, determine or otherwise ascertain that the DTC participant which is claiming to be acting on behalf of an ADS holder in requesting registration of transfer and delivery described in the paragraph above has the actual authority to act on behalf of the ADS holder (notwithstanding any requirements under the Uniform Commercial Code). In the deposit agreement, the parties agree that the depositary’s reliance on, and compliance with, instructions received by the depositary through the DRS/Profile System and in accordance with the deposit agreement, shall not constitute negligence or bad faith on the part of the depositary.

	<b><a name="T33">SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Upon the completion of this offering, we will have             ADSs outstanding representing approximately             % of our ordinary shares (or             ADSs outstanding representing approximately     % of our ordinary shares, if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional ADSs), based on the number of ordinary shares outstanding as of December 31, 2013. All of the ADSs sold in this offering and the ordinary shares they represent will be freely transferable by persons other than our “affiliates” without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act. Rule 144 under the Securities Act defines an “affiliate” of a company as a person that, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, our company. All outstanding ordinary shares prior to this offering are “restricted securities” as that term is defined in Rule 144 because they were issued in a transaction or series of transactions not involving a public offering. Restricted securities, in the form of ADSs or otherwise, may be sold only if they are the subject of an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or if they are sold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirement of the Securities Act such as those provided for in Rule 144 or 701 promulgated under the Securities Act, which rules are summarized below. Restricted ordinary shares may also be sold outside of the United States to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Act. This prospectus may not be used in connection with any resale of our ADSs acquired in this offering by our affiliates. <br><br>

Sales of substantial amounts of our ADSs in the public market could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our ADSs. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our ordinary shares or ADSs, and while we have applied to list our ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Global Market, we cannot assure you that a regular trading market will develop in the ADSs. We do not expect that a trading market will develop for our ordinary shares not represented by ADSs. 
<br><br>
Lock-up Agreements <br><br>

We, the selling shareholders, and our directors, executive officers and certain other existing shareholders and option holders holding in the aggregate     % of our outstanding ordinary shares have agreed, subject to some exceptions, not to sell, transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of our ordinary shares, in the form of ADSs or otherwise, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our ordinary shares, in the form of ADSs or otherwise, for a period of              days after the date of this prospectus. After the expiration of the             -day period, the ordinary shares or ADSs held by the selling shareholders, our directors, executive officers or our other existing shareholders or certain option holders may be sold subject to the restrictions under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or other exemptions from registration with the SEC or by means of SEC-registered public offerings. 
<br><br>
Rule 144 
<br><br>
In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person who has beneficially owned our restricted securities for at least six months is entitled to sell the restricted securities without registration under the Securities Act, subject to certain restrictions. Persons who are our affiliates (including persons beneficially owning 10% or more of our outstanding shares) may sell within any three-month period a number of restricted securities that does not exceed the greater of the following: <br><br>

 

--1% of the number of our ordinary shares then outstanding, in the form of ADSs or otherwise, which will equal approximately             ordinary shares immediately after this offering; and  
<br><br>
 

--the average weekly trading volume of our ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Global Market during the four calendar weeks preceding the date on which notice of the sale is filed with the SEC.  
<br><br>
Such sales are also subject to manner-of-sale provisions, notice requirements and the availability of current public information about us. <br><br>

In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, once we have been subject to the public company reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act for at least 90 days, persons who are not our affiliates and have beneficially owned our restricted securities for more than six months but not more than one year may sell the restricted securities without registration under the Securities Act subject to the availability of current public information about us. Persons who are not our affiliates and have beneficially owned our restricted securities for more than one year may freely sell the restricted securities without registration under the Securities Act. 
<br><br>
Rule 701 <br><br>

Beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus, persons other than affiliates who purchased ordinary shares under a written compensatory plan or contract may be entitled to sell such shares in the United States in reliance on Rule 701 under the Securities Act, or Rule 701. Rule 701 permits affiliates to sell their Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding period requirements of Rule 144. Rule 701 further provides that non-affiliates may sell these shares in reliance on Rule 144 subject only to its manner-of-sale requirements. However, the Rule 701 shares would remain subject to any applicable lock-up arrangements and would only become eligible for sale when the lock-up period expires. 
<br><br>
Registration Rights <br><br>

Upon completion of this offering, certain holders of our ordinary shares or their transferees will be entitled to request that we register their ordinary shares under the Securities Act, following the expiration of the lock-up agreements described above. See “Description of Share Capital ― Registration Rights.”

	<b><a name="T34">TAXATION</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The following is a general summary of certain Cayman Islands, PRC and United States federal income tax consequences relevant to an investment in our ADSs and ordinary shares. The discussion is not intended to be, nor should it be construed as, legal or tax advice to any particular prospective purchaser. The discussion is based on laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which are subject to change or different interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. The discussion does not address U.S. state or local tax laws, or tax laws of jurisdictions other than the Cayman Islands, the People’s Republic of China and the United States. You should consult your own tax advisors with respect to the consequences of acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ADSs and ordinary shares. <br><br>

Cayman Islands Taxation <br><br>

The Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty or withholding tax applicable to us or to any holder of our ADSs and ordinary shares. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or after execution brought within, the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. No stamp duty is payable in the Cayman Islands on the issue of shares by, or any transfers of shares of, Cayman Islands companies (except those which hold interests in land in the Cayman Islands). The Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties that are applicable to any payments made to or by our company. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands. 
<br><br>
Payments of dividends and capital in respect of our ADSs and ordinary shares will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no withholding will be required on the payment of a dividend or capital to any holder of our ADSs or ordinary shares, as the case may be, nor will gains derived from the disposal of our ADSs or ordinary shares be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax.

People’s Republic of China Taxation 
<br><br>
We are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and we gain substantial income by way of dividends from our PRC subsidiaries. The EIT Law and its implementation rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008, provide that China-sourced income of foreign enterprises, such as dividends paid by a PRC subsidiary to its equity holders that are non-resident enterprises, will normally be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of 10%, unless any such foreign investor’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. 
<br><br>
Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with a “de facto management body” within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” which means that it is treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. Although the implementation rules of the EIT Law define “de facto management body” as a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management and control over the production and business, personnel, accounting books and assets of an enterprise, the only official guidance for this definition currently available is set forth in Circular 82 issued by the State Administration of Taxation, which provides guidance on the determination of the tax residence status of a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise, defined as an enterprise that is incorporated under the laws of a foreign country or territory and that has a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as its primary controlling shareholder. Although Alibaba Group Holding Limited does not have a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as our primary controlling shareholder and is therefore not a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise within the meaning of Circular 82, in the absence of guidance specifically applicable to us, we have applied the guidance set forth in Circular 82 to evaluate the tax residence status of Alibaba Group Holding Limited and its subsidiaries organized outside the PRC. 
<br><br>
According to Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are met: 
<br><br>
 

--the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC;  

 <br><br>

--decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC;  

 <br><br>

--the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholders meeting minutes are located or maintained in the PRC; and  

 <br><br>

--50% or more of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.  
<br><br>
We do not believe that we meet any of the conditions outlined in the immediately preceding paragraph. Alibaba Group Holding Limited and its offshore subsidiaries are incorporated outside the PRC. As a holding company, our key assets and records, including the resolutions and meeting minutes of our board of directors and the resolutions and meeting minutes of our shareholders, are located and maintained outside the PRC. In addition, we are not aware of any offshore holding companies with a corporate structure similar to ours that has been deemed a PRC “resident enterprise” by the PRC tax authorities. Accordingly, we believe that Alibaba Group Holding Limited and its offshore subsidiaries should not be treated as a “resident enterprise” for PRC tax purposes if the criteria for “de facto management body” as set forth in Circular 82 were deemed applicable to us. However, as the tax residency status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body” as applicable to our offshore entities, we will continue to monitor our tax status. 
<br><br>
The implementation rules of the EIT Law provide that, (i) if the enterprise that distributes dividends is domiciled in the PRC or (ii) if gains are realized from transferring equity interests of enterprises domiciled in the PRC, then such dividends or capital gains are treated as China-sourced income. It is not clear how “domicile” may be interpreted under the EIT Law, and it may be interpreted as the jurisdiction where the enterprise is a tax resident. Therefore, if we are considered as a PRC tax resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders or ADS holders which are non-resident enterprises as well as gains realized by such shareholders or ADS holders from the transfer of our shares or ADSs may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result become subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%. <br><br>

Furthermore, if we are considered a PRC resident enterprise and the competent PRC tax authorities consider dividends we pay with respect to our shares or ADSs and the gains realized from the transfer of our shares or ADSs to be income derived from sources within the PRC, such dividends and gains we pay to our overseas shareholders or ADS holders who are non-resident individuals may be subject to PRC individual income tax at a rate of 20%, unless any such non-resident individuals’ jurisdiction has a tax treaty with China that provides for a preferential tax rate or a tax exemption. It is also unclear whether, if we are considered a PRC resident enterprise, holders of our shares or ADSs would be able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties or agreements entered into between China and other countries or areas. 
<br><br>
See “Risk Factors ― Risks Related to Doing Business in the People’s Republic of China ― We may be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, and we may therefore be subject to PRC income tax on our global income.” and “Risk Factors ― Risks Related to Doing Business in the People’s Republic of China ― Dividends payable to our foreign investors and gains on the sale of our ADSs or ordinary shares by our foreign investors may become subject to PRC tax law.” <br><br>

Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations 
<br><br>
The following summary describes the material United States federal income tax consequences of the ownership of our ordinary shares and ADSs as of the date hereof. The discussion set forth below is applicable only to United States Holders. Except where noted, this summary deals only with ordinary shares and ADSs held as capital assets. As used herein, the term “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of an ordinary share or ADS that is for United States federal income tax purposes: 
<br><br>
 

--an individual citizen or resident of the United States;  
<br><br>
 

--a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  
<br><br>
 

--an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  

 <br><br>

--a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons has or have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.  
<br><br>
This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including if you are: 

 <br><br>

--a dealer in securities or currencies;  

 <br><br>

--a financial institution;  

 <br><br>

--a regulated investment company;  

 <br><br>

--a real estate investment trust;  

 <br><br>

--an insurance company;  

 
<br><br>
--a tax-exempt organization;  

 <br><br>

--a person holding our ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a hedging, integrated or conversion transaction, a constructive sale or a straddle;  
<br><br>
 

--a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;  
<br><br>
 

--a person liable for alternative minimum tax;  

 <br><br>

--a person who owns or is deemed to own 10% or more of our voting stock;  

 <br><br>

--a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes; or  

 <br><br>

--a person whose “functional currency” is not the United States dollar.  
<br><br>
The discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and regulations, rulings and judicial decisions thereunder as of the date hereof, and such authorities may be replaced, revoked or modified so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. In addition, this summary is based, in part, upon representations made by the depositary to us and assumes that the deposit agreement, and all other related agreements, will be performed in accordance with their terms. 
<br><br>
If a partnership holds our ordinary shares or ADSs, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our ordinary shares or ADSs, you should consult your tax advisors. 
<br><br>
This summary does not contain a detailed description of all the United States federal income tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare tax on net investment income, or the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax laws. If you are considering the purchase, ownership or disposition of our ordinary shares or ADSs, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the United States federal income tax consequences to you in light of your particular situation as well as any consequences arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction. 
<br><br>
<a href= "link03.html">大国不能小心眼</a><br><br>
ADSs 
<br><br>
If you hold ADSs, for United States federal income tax purposes, you generally will be treated as the owner of the underlying ordinary shares that are represented by such ADSs. Accordingly, deposits or withdrawals of ordinary shares for ADSs will not be subject to United States federal income tax. 
<br><br>
Taxation of Dividends 
<br><br>
Subject to the discussion under “―Passive Foreign Investment Company” below, the gross amount of distributions on the ADSs or ordinary shares (including any amounts withheld to reflect PRC withholding taxes) will be taxable as dividends, to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. Such income (including withheld taxes) will be includable in your gross income as ordinary income on the day actually or constructively received by you, in the case of the ordinary shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADSs. Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations under the Code. The following discussion assumes that all dividends will be paid in U.S. dollars. 
<br><br>
With respect to non-corporate United States investors, certain dividends received from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on ordinary shares (or ADSs backed by such shares) that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. We have applied to list the ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Global Market. Provided that the listing is approved, Internal Revenue Service guidance indicates that our ADSs will be readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. Thus, we believe that dividends we pay on our ordinary shares that are represented by ADSs will meet the conditions required for the reduced tax rate. Since we do not expect that our ordinary shares will be listed on an established securities market, we do not believe that dividends that we pay on our ordinary shares that are not represented by ADSs currently meet the conditions required for these reduced tax rates. There can be no assurance that our ADSs will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in subsequent years. A qualified foreign corporation also includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of certain income tax treaties with the United States. In the event that we were deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the EIT Law, although no assurance can be given, we might be eligible for the benefits of the income tax treaty between the United States and the PRC (the “Treaty”), and if we were eligible for such benefits, dividends we pay on our ordinary shares, regardless of whether such shares are represented by ADSs, would be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation. See “Taxation ― People’s Republic of China Taxation.” Non-corporate United States Holders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as “investment income” pursuant to Section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given your particular circumstances. 
<br><br>
Non-corporate United States Holders will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any dividends received from us if we are a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, in the taxable year in which such dividends are paid or in the preceding taxable year. See “― Passive Foreign Investment Company” below. 
<br><br>
In the event that we were deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the EIT Law, you might be subject to PRC withholding taxes on dividends paid to you with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares. See “Taxation ― People’s Republic of China Taxation.” In that case, subject to certain conditions and limitations, PRC withholding taxes on dividends would be treated as foreign taxes eligible for credit against your United States federal income tax liability. For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit, dividends paid on the ADSs or ordinary shares will be treated as foreign-source income and will generally constitute passive category income. However, in certain circumstances, if you have held the ADSs or ordinary shares for less than a specified minimum period during which you are not protected from risk of loss, or are obligated to make payments related to the dividends, you will not be allowed a foreign tax credit for any PRC withholding taxes imposed on dividends paid on the ADSs or ordinary shares. If you are eligible for Treaty benefits, any PRC taxes on dividends will not be creditable against your United States federal income tax liability to the extent withheld at a rate exceeding the applicable Treaty rate. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances. 
<br><br>
To the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits for a taxable year, as determined under United States federal income tax principles, the distribution will first be treated as a tax-free return of capital, causing a reduction in the adjusted basis of the ADSs or ordinary shares (thereby increasing the amount of gain, or decreasing the amount of loss, to be recognized by you on a subsequent disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares), and the balance in excess of adjusted basis will be taxed as capital gain recognized on a sale or exchange, as described below under “―Taxation of Capital Gains.” Consequently, such distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would generally not give rise to foreign source income and you would generally not be able to use the foreign tax credit arising from any PRC withholding tax imposed on such distributions unless such credit can be applied (subject to applicable limitations) against United States federal income tax due on other foreign source income in the appropriate category for foreign tax credit purposes. However, we do not expect to keep earnings and profits in accordance with United States federal income tax principles. Therefore, you should expect that a distribution will generally be treated as a dividend (as discussed above). 
<br><br>
Distributions of ADSs, ordinary shares or rights to subscribe for ordinary shares that are received as part of a pro rata distribution to all of our shareholders generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax. Consequently, such distributions generally will not give rise to foreign source income and you generally will not be able to use the foreign tax credit arising from any PRC withholding tax imposed on such distributions unless such credit can be applied (subject to applicable limitations) against United States federal income tax due on other foreign source income in the appropriate category for foreign tax credit purposes. 
<br><br>
Passive Foreign Investment Company 
<br><br>
Based on the projected composition of our income and valuation of our assets, including goodwill, we do not expect to be a PFIC for our current taxable year, and we do not expect to become one in the future, although there can be no assurance in this regard. 
<br><br>
In general, we will be a PFIC for any taxable year in which: 

 <br><br>

--at least 75% of our gross income is passive income; or  
<br><br>
 

--at least 50% of the value (determined on a quarterly basis) of our assets is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income.  
<br><br>
For this purpose, passive income generally includes dividends, interest, royalties and rents (other than royalties and rents derived in the active conduct of a trade or business and not derived from a related person). If we own at least 25% (by value) of the stock of another corporation, we will be treated, for purposes of the PFIC tests, as owning our proportionate share of the other corporation’s assets and receiving our proportionate share of the other corporation’s income. Although we do not expect to be a PFIC, it is not entirely clear how the contractual arrangements between us and our variable interest entities will be treated for purposes of the PFIC rules. If it were determined that we do not own the stock of our variable interest entities for United States federal income tax purposes (for instance, because the relevant PRC authorities do not respect these arrangements), we may be treated as a PFIC. 
<br><br>
The determination of whether we are a PFIC is made annually. Accordingly, it is possible that we may become a PFIC in the current or any future taxable year due to changes in our asset or income composition. Because we have valued our goodwill based on the projected market value of our equity, a decrease in the price of our ADSs may also result in our becoming a PFIC. The composition of our income and our assets will also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use the proceeds from this offering. Under circumstances where the cash is not deployed for active purposes, our risk of becoming a PFIC may increase. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which you hold our ADSs or ordinary shares, you will be subject to special tax rules discussed below. 
<br><br>
If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which you hold our ADSs or ordinary shares, you will be subject to special tax rules with respect to any “excess distribution” received and any gain realized from a sale or other disposition, including a pledge, of ADSs or ordinary shares. Distributions received in a taxable year that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received during the shorter of the three preceding taxable years or your holding period for the ADSs or ordinary shares will be treated as excess distributions. Under these special tax rules: 

 <br><br>

--the excess distribution or gain will be allocated ratably over your holding period for the ADSs or ordinary shares;  

 <br><br>

--the amount allocated to the current taxable year, and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a PFIC, will be treated as ordinary income; and  
<br><br>
 

--the amount allocated to each other year will be subject to tax at the highest tax rate in effect for that year and the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the resulting tax attributable to each such year.  
<br><br>
In addition, non-corporate United States Holders will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any dividends received from us if we are a PFIC in the taxable year in which such dividends are paid or in the preceding taxable year. You will generally be required to file Internal Revenue Service Form 8621 if you hold our ADSs or ordinary shares in any year in which we are classified as a PFIC. 
<br><br>
If we were a PFIC for any taxable year during which you hold our ADSs or ordinary shares and any of our non-United States subsidiaries was also a PFIC, a United States Holder would be treated as owning a proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC for purposes of the application of these rules. You are urged to consult your tax advisors about the application of the PFIC rules to any of our subsidiaries. 
<br><br>
In certain circumstances, in lieu of being subject to the excess distribution rules discussed above, you may make an election to include gain on the stock of a PFIC as ordinary income under a mark-to-market method, provided that such stock is regularly traded on a qualified exchange. Under current law, the mark-to-market election may be available to United States Holders of ADSs if the ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Global Market, which constitutes a qualified exchange, and are “regularly traded” for purposes of the mark-to-market election (for which no assurance can be given). It should also be noted that it is intended that only the ADSs and not the ordinary shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Global Market. Consequently, if you are a United States Holder of ordinary shares that are not represented by ADSs, you generally will not be eligible to make a mark-to-market election if we are or were to become a PFIC. 
<br><br>
If you make an effective mark-to-market election, you will include in each year that we are a PFIC as ordinary income the excess of the fair market value of your ADSs at the end of the year over your adjusted tax basis in the ADSs. You will be entitled to deduct as an ordinary loss in each such year the excess of your adjusted tax basis in the ADSs over their fair market value at the end of the year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. If you make an effective mark-to-market election, in each year that we are a PFIC any gain you recognize upon the sale or other disposition of your ADSs will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as ordinary loss, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. 
<br><br>
Your adjusted tax basis in the ADSs will be increased by the amount of any income inclusion and decreased by the amount of any deductions under the mark-to-market rules. If you make a mark-to-market election it will be effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years unless the ADSs are no longer regularly traded on a qualified exchange or the Internal Revenue Service consents to the revocation of the election. You are urged to consult your tax advisor about the availability of the mark-to-market election, and whether making the election would be advisable in your particular circumstances. 
<br><br>
Alternatively, you can sometimes avoid the rules described above by electing to treat a PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” under Section 1295 of the Code. However, this option is not available to you because we do not intend to comply with the requirements necessary to permit you to make this election. 
<br><br>
You are urged to consult your tax advisors concerning the United States federal income tax consequences of holding ADSs or ordinary shares if we are considered a PFIC in any taxable year. 
<br><br>
Taxation of Capital Gains 
<br><br>
For United States federal income tax purposes, you will recognize taxable gain or loss on any sale or exchange of ADSs or ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized for the ADSs or ordinary shares and your tax basis in the ADSs or ordinary shares. Subject to the discussion under “―Passive Foreign Investment Company” above, such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of individuals derived with respect to capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss recognized by you will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss. However, if we were treated as a PRC resident enterprise for EIT Law purposes and PRC tax were imposed on any gain, and if you are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty, you may elect to treat such gain as PRC source gain under the Treaty. If you are not eligible for the benefits of the Treaty or you fail to make the election to treat any gain as PRC source, then you may not be able to use the foreign tax credit arising from any PRC tax imposed on the disposition of our ADSs or ordinary shares unless such credit can be applied (subject to applicable limitations) against tax due on other income derived from foreign sources. You will be eligible for the benefits of the Treaty if, for purposes of the Treaty, you are a resident of the United States, and you meet other requirements specified in the Treaty. Because the determination of whether you qualify for the benefits of the Treaty is fact-intensive and depends upon your particular circumstances, you are specifically urged to consult your tax advisors regarding your eligibility for the benefits of the Treaty. You are also urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences in case any PRC tax is imposed on gain on a disposition of our ADSs or ordinary shares, including the availability of the foreign tax credit and the election to treat any gain as PRC source, under your particular circumstances. 
<br><br>
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
<br><br>
In general, information reporting will apply to dividends in respect of our ADSs or ordinary shares and the proceeds from the sale, exchange or redemption of our ADSs or ordinary shares that are paid to you within the United States (and in certain cases, outside the United States), unless you are an exempt recipient. A backup withholding tax may apply to such payments if you fail to provide a taxpayer identification number or certification of other exempt status or, in the case of dividend payments, if you fail to report in full dividend and interest income. 
<br><br>
Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner. 
<br><br>
Under the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010, certain United States Holders are required to report information relating to ADSs or ordinary shares, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for ADSs or ordinary shares held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions), by attaching a complete Internal Revenue Service Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, with their tax return for each year in which they hold ADSs or ordinary shares. You are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding information reporting requirements relating to your ownership of the ADSs or ordinary shares.

	<b><a name="T35">UNDERWRITING </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We, the selling shareholders and the underwriters named below have entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the ADSs being offered. Under the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the underwriting agreement, each underwriter has severally agreed to purchase the number of ADSs indicated in the following table. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. are acting as joint bookrunners of this offering and as the representatives of the underwriters. 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic90.html">the representatives of the underwriters</a><br><br>
The underwriters are offering the ADSs subject to their acceptance of the ADSs from us and the selling shareholders and subject to prior sale. The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the several underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the ADSs offered by this prospectus are subject to the approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to certain other conditions. The underwriters are obligated, severally and not jointly, to take and pay for all of the ADSs offered by this prospectus if any such ADSs are taken, other than the ADSs covered by the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ADSs described below. The underwriting agreement also provides that if an underwriter defaults, the purchase commitments of non-defaulting underwriters may be increased or the offering may be terminated. 
<br><br>
The underwriters initially propose to offer part of the ADSs directly to the public at the public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus and part of the ADSs to certain dealers at a price that represents a concession not in excess of US$         per ADS from the initial public offering price. After the initial offering of the ADSs, the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time be varied by the underwriters. 
<br><br>
Certain of the underwriters are expected to make offers and sales both inside and outside the United States through their respective selling agents. Any offers or sales in the United States will be conducted by broker-dealers registered with the SEC. Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc will offer ADSs in the United States through its registered broker-dealer affiliate in the United States, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC. 
<br><br>
Rothschild Inc., or Rothschild, has acted as our independent financial advisor in connection with this offering. Rothschild is not acting as an underwriter in this offering, and accordingly it is neither purchasing ADSs nor offering ADSs to the public in connection with this offering. Neither Rothschild nor any of its affiliates is engaged in the solicitation or distribution of this offering. 
<br><br>
Option to Purchase Additional ADSs 
<br><br>
We and certain selling shareholders have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to an aggregate of             additional ADSs from us and             ADSs from certain selling shareholders at the public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus, less underwriters discounts and commissions. To the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter will become severally obligated, subject to certain conditions, to purchase additional ADSs approximately proportionate to each underwriter’s initial amount reflected in the table above. 
<br><br>
Commissions and Expenses 
<br><br>
Total underwriting discounts and commissions to be paid to the underwriters represent     % of the total amount of the offering. The following table shows the per ADS and total underwriting discounts and commissions to be paid to the underwriters by us and the selling shareholders. Such amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ADSs. 
<br><br>

<a href= "pic91.html">Discounts and commissions </a><br><br>

The underwriters have agreed to reimburse us for a certain portion of our expenses in connection with our initial public offering. 
<br><br>
The estimated offering expenses payable by us, exclusive of the underwriting discounts and commissions, are approximately US$            , which includes legal, accounting, and printing costs and various other fees associated with the registration of our ordinary shares and ADSs. 
<br><br>
Lock-Up Agreements 
<br><br>
We have agreed that, without the prior written consent of the representatives on behalf of the underwriters, we will not, during the period ending              days after the date of this prospectus, take any of the following actions with respect to our ordinary shares or ADSs, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of our ordinary shares or ADSs (“Lock-Up Securities”): (i) offer, sell, pledge, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of Lock-Up Securities, (ii) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, contract to purchase or grant any option, right or warrant to purchase Lock-Up Securities, (iii) establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position in Lock-Up Securities within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act or (iv) file with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to Lock-Up Securities, subject to certain exceptions. 
<br><br>
Our executive officers, directors, the selling shareholders and certain of the other holders of our ordinary shares holding in the aggregate         % of our ordinary shares have agreed with the underwriters not to sell, transfer or dispose of any ADSs, ordinary shares or similar securities for a period of      days after the date of this prospectus subject to certain exceptions. 
<br><br>
New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Global Market Listing 
<br><br>
We expect the ADSs to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “         .” 
<br><br>
Stabilization, Short Positions and Penalty Bids 
<br><br>
In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell ADSs in the open market. These transactions may include short sales in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of ADSs than they are required to purchase in the offering. “Covered” short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ADSs in the offering. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional ADSs or purchasing ADSs in the open market. In determining the source of ADSs to close out the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of ADSs available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional ADSs pursuant to the option granted to them. “Naked” short sales are any sales in excess of such option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing ADSs in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the ADSs in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for, or purchases of, ADSs made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. 
<br><br>
The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased ADSs sold by, or for the account of, such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions. 
<br><br>
Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the ADSs, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the ADSs. As a result, the price of the ADSs may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they are required to be conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and they may be discontinued at any time. These transactions may be effected on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market, the over-the-counter market or otherwise.
<br><br>
Electronic Distribution 
<br><br>
A prospectus in electronic format will be made available on the websites maintained by one or more of the underwriters or one or more securities dealers. One or more of the underwriters may distribute prospectuses electronically. The underwriters may agree to allocate a number of ADSs for sale to their online brokerage account holders. ADSs to be sold pursuant to an Internet distribution will be allocated on the same basis as other allocations. In addition, ADSs may be sold by the underwriters to securities dealers who resell ADSs to online brokerage account holders. 
<br><br>
<a href= "link03.html">大国不能小心眼</a><br><br>
Discretionary Sales 
<br><br>
The underwriters do not intend sales to discretionary accounts to exceed five percent of the total number of ADSs offered by them. 
<br><br>
Indemnification 
<br><br>
We and the selling shareholders have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

	<b><a name="T38">WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We have filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-1, including relevant exhibits and schedules under the Securities Act with respect to underlying ordinary shares represented by the ADSs, to be sold in this offering. A related registration statement on F-6 will be filed with the SEC to register the ADSs. This prospectus, which constitutes a part of the registration statement, does not contain all of the information contained in the registration statement. You should read the registration statement and its exhibits and schedules for further information with respect to us and our ADSs. 
<br><br>
Immediately upon completion of this offering, we will become subject to periodic reporting and other informational requirements of the Exchange Act as applicable to foreign private issuers. Accordingly, we will be required to file reports, including annual reports on Form 20-F, and other information with the SEC. All information filed with the SEC can be inspected and copied at the public reference room maintained by the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You can request copies of these documents upon payment of a duplicating fee, by writing to the SEC. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the operation of the public reference rooms. Additional information may also be obtained over the Internet at the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov. 
<br><br>
As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt under the Exchange Act from, among other things, the rules prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our executive officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we will not be required under the Exchange Act to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. However, we intend to furnish the depositary with our annual reports, which will include a review of operations and annual audited consolidated combined financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and all notices of shareholders’ meetings and other reports and communications that are made generally available to our shareholders. The depositary will make such notices, reports and communications available to holders of ADSs and will mail to all record holders of ADSs the information contained in any notice of a shareholders’ meeting received by the depositary from us.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Alibaba Group Holding Limited: 
<br><br>
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alibaba Group Holding Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) at March 31, 2012 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
